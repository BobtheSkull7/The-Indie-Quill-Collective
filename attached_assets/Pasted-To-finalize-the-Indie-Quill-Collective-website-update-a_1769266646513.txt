To finalize the Indie Quill Collective website update and the National Literacy Directory (NLD) profile, we need to bridge the gap between your "high-level" mission and the "community-level" accessibility required for public listings.

Below is the summary of the changes we have made, formatted for your website, followed by the specific details for your NLD images.

Website Update: "Our Current Work" Section
You can copy this text directly to your site to reflect the new direction:

Project: Frictionless Literacy (Adult Authorship Path)

The Mission: We provide a path for all children and adults silenced by discrimination and lack of privilege to speak their minds, protect their history, and build a published legacy that belongs to them.

The Literacy Point: We teach the active craft of writing as a foundational key to literacy. By learning to author their own stories, our participants gain the tools to decode and understand the world around them more fluently.

Our Impact Goal: We are currently focused on serving 20 individuals, with a deep commitment to bridging the literacy gap for Black and Hispanic learners.

NLD Image Setup (The Two Images)
Since you are in a Facebook "timeout," focus on these two images for your NLD profile. You will need to upload the files and provide a "Caption" or "Alt-Text" at a 4th–6th grade reading level.

Image 1: The Technology Tool

Visual: A photo of a laptop or tablet showing a writing interface, or a photo of a printed "Legacy Book."


NLD Caption (4th-6th Grade Level): "We use computers and tablets to help you write your book. Our tools make it easy for everyone to become an author".

Image 2: The Learning Path

Visual: A mentor and a student working together, or a small group in a library or community center.


NLD Caption (4th-6th Grade Level): "You can work with a teacher or a volunteer to tell your story. We provide free help for all adults and children in our community".

Final Checklist for Your Site & Profile

ProLiteracy Badge: Since the Collective is joining as a Partner Member, you can add the ProLiteracy logo to your "Partners" or "Affiliations" section on your website.

Contact Consistency: Ensure the email address and P.O. Box on your website match exactly what you entered in the NLD Program Information section.

National Literacy Directory ID: Once your NLD account is approved (usually 24–48 hours), you will receive your ID Number. You must add this number to your Dollar General Adult Literacy Application before the February 5th deadline.

Would you like me to draft the "About the Executive Director" blurb for your site that incorporates your role as the chief architect of this mission?
