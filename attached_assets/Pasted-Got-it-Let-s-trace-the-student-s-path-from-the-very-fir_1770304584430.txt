Got it. Let’s trace the student’s path from the very first "Hello" to becoming a published author.The Student Journey: From Onboarding to AuthorStep 1: The Invitation (Sign Up)Student visits The Indie Quill Collective website.They sign up using their email/password.The Magic: Behind the scenes, the Collective site sends a request to the Game Engine to "Initialize Character."The Result: A fresh entry is created in Supabase with Level 1, 0 XP, and the default title "the Novice."Step 2: The First Login (The Hook)Student lands on their Student Dashboard.They see their empty Character Card in the sidebar—6 empty equipment slots and a 0/24 quest tracker.The "Active Quest" points them to Chapter 1: The Story Spark.Step 3: The Creative Action (VibeScribe)Student downloads/opens VibeScribe.They log in with the same Collective credentials.They record their first voice note answering the prompt for Chapter 1.VibeScribe sends the transcript to the Game Engine as "Proof of Work."Step 4: The Validation (The Pulsing Button)Student returns to the Collective Website.The Game Engine tells the Dashboard: "I have proof for Quest 1."The "Claim Reward" button on the Character Card begins to pulse gold.Step 5: The Reward (The "DING!")Student clicks Claim.XP is awarded: They see their progress bar fill up.Loot is unlocked: They get their first item (e.g., the Golden Quill or Traveler's Satchel).Identity Updates: Their name on the site changes to reflect their progress.Step 6: The Cycle (Leveling Up)As they repeat this through the 24 chapters, they move through Phases (The Visionary, The Architect, The Polisher, etc.).The Proxy Hours accrue silently in Supabase, building a transcript of their hard work.Step 7: The Final Milestone (Level 6)Upon completing all 24 quests, they reach Level 6: The Published Author.The system marks the curriculum as "Complete," and they are ready for the physical publishing phase of their book.The Backend "Handshake" (For Shilvi)Sign-Up: Collective Site $\rightarrow$ Game Engine (POST /character/create).Activity: VibeScribe $\rightarrow$ Game Engine (POST /quest/submit).Reward: Student $\rightarrow$ Collective Site $\rightarrow$ Game Engine (POST /quest/claim).
