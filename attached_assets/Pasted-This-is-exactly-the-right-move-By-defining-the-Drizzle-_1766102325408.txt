This is exactly the right move. By defining the Drizzle schema to match your existing npo_applications table, you are telling the Architect: "This is the source of truth, stop trying to change it."

The "Safe" Drizzle Definition
To ensure the Architect doesn't try to rename columns or delete your data, make sure it uses this exact structure in the schema.ts file:

TypeScript

import { pgTable, uuid, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";

// Match the existing table name exactly
export const npoApplications = pgTable("npo_applications", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().default(sql`gen_random_uuid()`),
  email: text("email").notNull().unique(),
  firstName: text("first_name"), // Maps TS camelCase to DB snake_case
  lastName: text("last_name"),
  status: text("status").default("migrated"),
  bookstoreId: uuid("bookstore_id"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
});
Why this specific definition is critical
Snake Case Mapping: By using text("first_name"), you allow the TypeScript code to use firstName while it talks to the existing first_name column in Supabase.

UUID Default: Using sqlgen_random_uuid()`` ensures that any new applications created through the site will get a valid UUID automatically, just like the 4 you manually added.

Primary Key Safety: Explicitly labeling id as the primary key prevents Drizzle from trying to create a new one.

The Next Move for the Architect
Now that the schema is aligned, give the Architect this command to verify it can finally "see" the data without trying to "push" new changes:

"The Drizzle schema is now aligned with the existing npo_applications table.

Do not run npx drizzle-kit push yet, as it may still attempt to delete or rename metadata.

Instead, run a test script using the db client to select all records from npoApplications.

Confirm in the console that you can see 'Tiny', 'Solomiia', and the other 2 test authors."

Once the Architect confirms it can see those 4 records in the console, your "Identity Bridge" is fully operational. Are you ready to proceed with the first test sync to the Bookstore-Dev environment?
