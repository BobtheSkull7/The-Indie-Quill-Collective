Task 1: The "Identity Birth" (For the Collective/Render Agent)
Goal: Automate the transition from a "New Signup" to a "Live RPG Character."

The Instruction for Replit:

"Implement the Admin Approval Handshake.

Database: In the users table, ensure there is a status column (default: 'pending').

Admin Action: On the Admin Dashboard, create an 'Approve Student' button for pending users.

The Trigger: When clicked, the app must:

Update user status to 'active'.

Send a POST request to the Game Engine API (/character/create) with the user_id and username.

Send an automated 'Welcome to the Collective' email that includes a link to the Student Dashboard."

Task 2: The "Student Vault" (For the Collective/Render Agent)
Goal: Create the storage for VibeScribe snippets and manuscripts.

The Instruction for Replit:

"Set up the Student Work Vault using our Supabase connection.

New Table: Create a student_work table with columns for user_id, quest_id, content_type (e.g., 'vibescribe_snippet', 'manuscript_draft'), and content_body (text).

API Endpoint: Create a secure internal API route that accepts incoming text from the Game Engine and saves it to this table.

The Workspace: Create a 'My Manuscript' tab on the Student Dashboard that pulls all entries from this table so the student can see their voice-to-text snippets in one place."

Task 3: The "VibeScribe Handshake" (For the VibeScribe Agent)
Goal: Make the mobile app talk to the Game Engine.

The Instruction for Replit:

"Connect VibeScribe to the Indie Quill Game Engine.

Authentication: On login, store the student's user_id.

Submission Logic: When a user hits 'Save' on a voice-to-text recording:

Send a POST request to https://curriculum-import-tool.replit.app/quest/submit/{user_id}/{quest_id}.

Include the transcribed text in the proof_text field of the JSON body.

Success Feedback: Show a 'Proof Submitted!' message to the student so they know to check their Collective Dashboard for rewards."

Task 4: The "Quest Logic" (For the Game Engine/Replit Agent)
Goal: Define the targets and rewards for the remaining chapters.

The Instruction for Replit:

"We need to finalize the Curriculum Logic for all 24 chapters.

Target Mapping: Update the database to ensure every quest (1–24) has a defined XP reward and specific item unlock.

Proof Verification: Ensure that when a POST is received from VibeScribe, the quest status in the Game Engine shifts to 'claimable'.

The 'Ding' Sync: Ensure the claim_reward function correctly triggers the Level Up logic and updates the equipped_items if a student reaches a phase milestone (Level 2, 3, etc.)."
