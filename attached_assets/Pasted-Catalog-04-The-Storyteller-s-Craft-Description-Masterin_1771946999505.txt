Catalog 04: The Storyteller’s Craft
Description: Mastering the art of the short form. Learn to capture a whole world in just a few pages.

Lesson 01: The Single Spark
Content: [Foundation: “A short story is the map of a single moment.”]
In a long novel, you have time to wander. But in Short Form storytelling, you need a Single Spark. This is one specific idea or "What If?" that starts and ends quickly. Ray Bradbury used to say a short story should be like a "firecracker"—one bright flash that leaves the reader thinking.

Instead of a whole life story, we focus on a Sliver of Time. Maybe it's just one dinner, one walk, or one difficult conversation. By keeping the time short, you make the emotions feel much stronger. You aren't building a whole mountain; you are polishing a single diamond.

Your goal is to find the Emotional Core. What is the one feeling you want the reader to have when they finish? If you know the "Spark," you won't get lost in too many details. You will stay focused on the heart of the moment.

Tasks for L01:

Speaking: The Spark — "What is the 'What If?' for your short story? Tell me the one specific moment or event that the whole story is about."

Comprehension: The Firecracker — "Why is it better to focus on a 'Sliver of Time' rather than a character's whole life in a short story?"

Writing: The Core Feeling — "Type one word that describes how you want your reader to feel at the very end (e.g., 'Hopeful,' 'Chilled,' or 'Relieved')."

Lesson 02: Starting in the Middle
Content: [Foundation: “Don't clear your throat; just start singing.”]
In a short story, we don't have time for long introductions. We use a trick called In Media Res. This is just a fancy way of saying "Starting in the middle of the action." You want to drop your reader right into the messiest part of the story on page one.

Imagine a character is already running, or an argument is already happening. You don't need to explain how they got there yet. The reader's brain is very smart—they will catch up! By skipping the "boring parts" at the beginning, you grab the reader's attention and never let go.

We call this Economy of Language. It means using the smallest number of words to make the biggest impact. Every sentence has to earn its place in a short story. If a sentence doesn't move the story forward or show us who the character is, we let it go.

Tasks for L02:

Speaking: The Jump — "Describe a scene where your character is already doing something exciting. Don't explain why—just tell me what is happening right now."

Comprehension: The Boring Parts — "What does 'Economy of Language' mean, and why is it important when you only have a few pages to tell a story?"

Writing: The First Line — "Write a first line for a story that starts right in the middle of the action. (Example: 'The third time the phone rang, I knew I shouldn't have answered.')"

Lesson 03: The Power of One
Content: [Foundation: “One hero, one goal, one obstacle.”]
Because we have limited space, we follow the Rule of One. A great short story usually has One Main Character, One Clear Goal, and One Big Obstacle. If you try to add too many people or too many problems, the story gets "blurry."

We focus on the Internal Shift. In a novel, a character might change their whole life. In a short story, they might just change their mind about one thing. That small shift is where the magic happens. It’s the "Aha!" moment that the reader is waiting for.

By keeping the focus tight, you make the ending much more powerful. You are shining a bright spotlight on one specific truth. When you master the "Rule of One," your stories will feel sharp, professional, and unforgettable.

Tasks for L03:

Speaking: The Goal — "Who is your 'One Hero' and what is the 'One Goal' they are trying to reach in this short story?"

Comprehension: The Spotlight — "Why does adding too many characters make a short story feel 'blurry'?"

Writing: The Small Shift — "Type one sentence describing how your character’s thinking will change by the end of the story."
