To move from the "abandoned pages" state into your 1M-Mile Architecture, we need to stop thinking about these as individual pages and start thinking about them as Tab Content.Replit has built the rooms, but the furniture is scattered in the hallway. Here is the exact "Refurbishing Plan" to consolidate these floating pages into your 4 primary containers.1. The Navigation Consolidation (The "Directives")Tell Replit to stop adding separate links to the Navbar and instead Nest the existing pages under your 4 Master Tabs. This cleans up the UI and enforces your business process.Main TabSub-Tabs (Floating Pages to Move Inside)IntakeCohorts (to create the buckets), Contracts (to verify sign-offs).TrainingCurriculumPlayer, FamilyDashboard, StudentDashboard.PublishingPublishingStatus (The Chevron View), DraftingSuite, Vault.OutcomesGrants (The CRM), Ledger (The Money), Auditor (The Zero-PII Reports).2. Rebuild Instructions for ReplitSince the pages already exist, do not ask Replit to "create" them. Ask it to "re-route and wrap" them.Directive 1: Create the Sub-Tab Routing"For each of the 4 main Admin views (Intake, Training, Publishing, Outcomes), implement a sub-navigation bar at the top of the page. Use the existing floating components to fill these tabs."Directive 2: Move the "Orphans" into their HomesIntake: "Wrap Cohorts.tsx and Contracts.tsx as tabs inside the /admin/intake route."Publishing: "Move the Vault.tsx logic into the final stage of the PublishingStatus.tsx chevron view. The 'Legal Identity' should only be accessible here."Outcomes: "The /admin/outcomes page should now have three tabs: Grants (CRM), Ledger (ISBN Arbitrage), and Auditor (Impact Analytics)."3. The "Missing Link" LogicYou mentioned things are still missing. Based on our 1M-mile plan, here is the "glue" Replit needs to write to connect these pages:From Intake to Training: "When a cohort is created in the Cohorts tab, it must be assigned a PathType (Literacy or General). This path should then dictate what the CurriculumPlayer shows to that cohort."From Publishing to Ledger: "When a manuscript status changes to 'ISBN Assigned' in the PublishingStatus view, automatically create an entry in the Ledger for the $777 sponsorship/cost tracking."4. VibeScribe 2.0 Integration (The Buildathon Edge)Since you want to submit this for the prize, do not put VibeScribe in the main Admin nav.Instruction for Replit:"Create a standalone, mobile-optimized route at /vibe. This is the entryway for the 6-digit Author ID (xxx-xxx). This route should be completely separate from the Admin Dashboard UI to stay 'Frictionless' for the families."
