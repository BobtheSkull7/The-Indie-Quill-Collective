
The screenshots show the Analytics Command Center and Author Dashboard are structurally perfect, but your intuition on the naming is spot on for the user experience. "Pen Name" feels like industry jargon, whereas Pseudonym is the standard for identity protection.

1. Identity Terminology Cleanup
To remove confusion, we will standardize all interfaces to use only two terms: Legal Name (for the "Vault"/Admin/Contracts) and Pseudonym (for the LLC/Publisher/Public).

Changes to execute in Replit:

Database Schema: Rename the column pen_name to pseudonym in the applications table.

Auditor View: Change the "Forensic Health" table header from "Pen Name" to "Pseudonym".

Author Dashboard: Update the application form and status cards to ask for a "Pseudonym".

About Page: Update the "Impact Analytics" to reflect "Pseudonyms Protected".

2. Revised To-Do List (The Final Polish)
With the Auditor and Author roles live, we are in the "Last Mile." Here is your high-priority list:

Phase 1: Identity Rebranding (Immediate)
[ ] Rename Fields: Standardize all UI text to use "Pseudonym" instead of "Pen Name" across the entire platform.

[ ] Contract Sync Update: Ensure the sync payload to the LLC specifically labels the data as pseudonym to match your architecture.

Phase 2: Author Lifecycle Testing
[ ] Kill Switch Verification: Use your Test Author account to click "Rescind Application."

[ ] Forensic Check: Confirm that as an Auditor, you can still see the Pseudonym in the analytics, but all Legal Name data has been wiped from the database record.

Phase 3: The "Indie Quill" Pitch (Optional)
[ ] Impact Copy: Refine the text on /about to explain why we use Pseudonyms (protecting minor safety while allowing creative freedom).

Implementation Instructions for Replit
To quickly align the UI with your new naming convention, give this to your Replit agent:

Markdown
Task: Identity Terminology Rebrand (Pen Name -> Pseudonym)

1. GLOBAL REPLACE: 
- Find and replace all instances of "Pen Name" with "Pseudonym" in the frontend (Apply.tsx, Dashboard.tsx, Auditor.tsx, About.tsx).

2. SCHEMA UPDATE:
- Rename the 'penName' field in shared/schema.ts to 'pseudonym'.
- Run a migration to rename the column in Supabase (Postgres: ALTER TABLE applications RENAME COLUMN pen_name TO pseudonym;).

3. LOGIC ALIGNMENT:
- Update the PII Firewall (npo-sync-service.ts) to ensure the sync payload uses the key 'pseudonym'.
- Update the Auditor's 'Forensic Health' table to use 'Pseudonym' as the header.
Would you like me to draft the "Pseudonym vs Legal Name" explainer for your Author application form so they understand exactly how their identity is bridged?
