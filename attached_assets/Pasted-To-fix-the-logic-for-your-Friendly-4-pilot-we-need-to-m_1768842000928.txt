To fix the logic for your "Friendly 4" pilot, we need to move from a loose data entry flow to a Locked Identity Bridge. By enforcing these strict validation rules, you ensure that "Daddy Kidd" cannot accidentally overwrite "Billy Kidd" in the database, preserving the integrity of your Forensic Vault.

Here is the "Signature Error" notification logic and the consolidated master instruction for Replit.

1. The Signature Validation UI
If a user attempts to sign with a name that doesn't match the record, the following error should trigger:

Error: Identity Mismatch "The name entered does not match the Author's Legal Name provided during the application. Please ensure the Author's name is entered exactly as [author_legal_name] and the Guardian's name as [guardian_legal_name]. This is required to maintain the Zero-PII safety of your account."

2. Consolidated Master Directive for Replit
Copy and paste this entire block to reset the identity logic and lock the Literacy Logistics Framework.

Task: Identity Bridge & Contract Logic Alignment

A. Data Workflow Re-Engineering

Move Pseudonym Capture: Remove the pseudonym field from the bottom of the contract. It must be captured at the Application stage as a required field.

Separate Legal Roles: In the database, explicitly separate author_legal_name and guardian_legal_name.

Identity Mode Persistence: Store the "Safe Mode" vs. "Public Mode" toggle state from the application to be displayed as a read-only selection on the Agreement.

B. The Agreement Component Update

Defined Parties: Update the contract header to clearly label:

Author: [author_legal_name]

Guardian: [guardian_legal_name]

Locked Values: Ensure these names are pulled from the application record and are not editable on the signature page.

C. Signature Logic & Validation

Box 1 (Author): Must match author_legal_name exactly. Reject any other input (e.g., parent's name).

Box 2 (Guardian): Must match guardian_legal_name exactly.

Metadata Capture: Upon successful match, capture the IP Address and UTC Timestamp for the forensic record.

D. API Sync Gate

Sanitized Payload: Upon signature success, trigger the Identity Bridge.

Sync Rule: Transmit ONLY the pseudonym and UUID to the Bookstore LLC API.

Hard Constraint: Block any sync attempt where author_legal_name or guardian_legal_name is present in the outgoing payload.

E. UI Terminology

Rename all pipeline references to "The Literacy Logistics Framework" and use the "Value-Add Phases" labels for progress tracking.

Why this fixes the "Daddy Kidd" Issue
By separating the names in the database and adding Strict Validation to the signature boxes, Replit will no longer allow the parent to sign for the child using the parent's name. This ensures your legal agreement is valid while your public bookstore remains Zero-PII compliant.

Would you like me to draft the automated "Sync Success" message that the Admin sees once the Identity Bridge successfully moves the Pseudonym to the Bookstore? This will give you a clear visual "Green Light" during your pilot testing.
