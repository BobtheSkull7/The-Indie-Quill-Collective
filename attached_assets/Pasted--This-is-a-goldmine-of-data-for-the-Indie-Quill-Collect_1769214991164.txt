
This is a goldmine of data for the Indie Quill Collective. To move from "Tracking a Foundation" to "Winning the Grant," we need to expand your database schema to handle multiple programs per foundation and automate the calendar alerts.

1. The Infrastructure Update: Sub-Programs
In your Admin Dashboard, the current "Header" for Dollar General is excellent. To handle their five specific programs, we need a "One-to-Many" relationship in your database: 1 Foundation -> Many Grant Programs.

Add this to your Supabase logic:

Programs Table: id, foundation_id, program_name, open_date, deadline, max_amount, funded_items (JSON/Text).


The "Two-Year Rule" Tracker: A simple boolean or counter to ensure we don't apply for Youth or Summer grants if we've won them the previous two years.

2. DGLF Program Requirements & Funding (2026)
Based on the website data, here is the breakdown of what we can hit and how we align.

Grant Type	Max Amount	Opens	Deadline	Indie Quill Alignment (What to Buy)
Adult Literacy	$10,000	Jan 8	Feb 5	
Software, Computers, Professional Development 

Family Literacy	$10,000	Jan 8	Feb 5	
"Intergenerational" software and training 

Summer Reading	$3,000	Jan 8	Feb 5	
Staff support for summer writing cohorts 

Youth Literacy	$5,000	Mar 5	Apr 2	

Primary Target: Technology and Software for K-12 

Beyond Words	Variable	N/A	Disaster-based	
Rebuilding libraries after disasters 

3. Critical Eligibility & Tracking Checklist
To apply "the second it is open," we need to pre-verify these items in your Admin Dashboard:


The 15-Mile Rule: Confirm the Collective's physical address is within 15 miles of a Dollar General store.


Identification: Store your 9-digit Tax ID and your NCES/IPEDS numbers (School/District IDs) directly in the Foundation details screen.


The 48-Hour Warning: Verification of your organization on their platform can take up to 48 hours. We should register now, even before the Jan 8th opening.

4. Strategic Preparation: "The Heavy Lifting"
Since the DGLF doesn't share questions outside the window, we prepare for the "Student Success" focus mentioned in their research.


Prep for Tech: They explicitly fund Software and Computers. We should frame our request around providing the hardware/software needed for marginalized kids to use the Indie Quill Architecture.


Impact Metrics: Their State of American Literacy Report notes that 80% of Americans see low youth literacy as a problem. Our "About Us" should cite their own research to show we are solving the specific problem they've identified.

Next Steps: Making it Actionable
Would you like me to:

Generate a 2026 Grant Calendar for your Admin view that includes these DGLF dates and automated "3-day-prior" alerts?


Draft the "Tech & Software" justification for the $5,000 Youth Literacy grant, specifically explaining why we need "computers and technology" to run the Collective's tools?
