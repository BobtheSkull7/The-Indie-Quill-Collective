o implement this 1M-mile blueprint, we need to restructure the current "containers" Replit has built to match the lifecycle of the writer.Here is the exact plan to transition your current navigation into the Indie Quill Impact Engine structure.1. Navigation Mapping (The User Interface)You should direct Replit to rename and re-route the top-level navigation as follows:Old LabelNew LabelAdmin Access Only?What lives here?HomeHomeNoGeneral landing for all users.AboutAboutNoThe Mission and Architecture story.ApplicantsIntakeYesEvery candidate, their status, and the link to their Grant/Cohort.DashboardTrainingYesAll curriculum paths and 120-hour modules.(New/Status)Publishing StatusYesThe chevron-view of manuscripts (Draft → Edit → ISBN → Done).GrantsOutcomesYesFinancials, DGLF Scorecard, Grant CRM, and Impact Reports.2. Directions for Replit: Grouping the ContentSince the "containers" already exist, you can tell the Replit agent to move the pieces into these specific "bins":A. The Intake ContainerMove: The current Applicants Tab from the Admin Dashboard.Add: A "Grant Tag" to every user card. This allows you to filter by "DGLF Cohort" or "Standard Cohort" immediately.Logic: This is where you move someone from a "Candidate" to an "Active Student."B. The Training ContainerMove: The Curriculum_modules and the 120-hour tracking logic.New Feature: "Path Selection." You need a toggle that says: If Cohort A (DGLF), show Literacy Path. If Cohort B (General), show Author Path.C. The Publishing Status ContainerMove: The drafting_documents and the "One-Click Publish" status.Visualization: Use a "Chevron" or "Pipeline" view. You want to see:Drafting → Editing → Identity Vault Locked → ISBN Assigned → Copyright Filed.D. The Outcomes ContainerMove: The foundation_crm, manual_ledger (ISBN Arbitrage), and the Grant Impact Aggregator.Content: This is strictly for the money and the metrics. It shows the use of every dollar and generates the PDF reports for your donors.3. The "Training Path" Rule for ReplitThe most important instruction for the Training container is the "Path Assignment" logic. You must tell Replit:"Every cohort is linked to exactly one grant. The Training module must dynamically load the curriculum path based on the Grant ID assigned in the Intake phase."
