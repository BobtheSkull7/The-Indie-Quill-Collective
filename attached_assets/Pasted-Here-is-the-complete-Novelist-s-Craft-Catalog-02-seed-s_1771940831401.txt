Catalog 02: The Novelist’s Craft
Description: Mastering the architecture of long-form fiction, from the Hero’s internal heartbeat to the final, world-changing climax.

Lesson 01: Your Hero's Big Wish
Content: [Foundation: “Your story starts when your character wants something they can't have yet.”]
Every story needs a Protagonist. That is just a fancy word for your 'Main Character' or the 'Hero' of your book. The most important thing about your Protagonist is their Burning Desire. This is the one big thing they want more than anything else in the world.

Think about your Hero. Do they want to find a lost treasure? Do they want to save their family? When your Hero has a Big Wish, it acts like an engine that pulls the reader through the story.

We also look for a Ghost. A Ghost isn't a spooky spirit; it’s just a sad memory or a secret fear from the Hero's past. This 'Ghost' makes it hard for them to get what they want. It creates a 'War Within' their own heart. Once you know what they want and what they are afraid of, your story will start to move on its own.

Tasks for L01:

Speaking: The Big Wish — "Tell me about your Hero. What is the one thing they want most, and what is the one 'Ghost' or fear that is holding them back?"

Comprehension: The Engine — "In your own words, why does a Hero need to 'want' something for the story to be exciting?"

Writing: The Hero's Name — "Type your Hero’s name and one sentence describing what they want to achieve by the end of the book."

Lesson 02: A World That Feels Real
Content: [Foundation: “The place where your story happens should feel like it's alive.”]
The Setting is the place where your story happens. To make it feel real, we don't just list every detail. Instead, we use Sensory Anchors. Pick one or two specific details—the smell of pine needles, the sound of a dry leaf crunching, or the cold feel of a metal door handle. This helps the reader feel like they are standing right next to your Hero.

Every place also has Unwritten Rules. These are things people in that world just 'know.' For example: 'In this town, nobody goes outside after the sun sets.' These rules create 'Passive Conflict.' This means the world itself is making things difficult for your Hero. When you build a world with its own smells, sounds, and rules, the reader stops feeling like they are reading a book and starts feeling like they are visiting a new place.

Tasks for L02:

Speaking: The Sensory Anchor — "Close your eyes. Describe your Hero’s home using only smells and sounds. Don't tell me what it looks like!"

Comprehension: The World's Rules — "What is an 'Unwritten Rule'? Give an example of a rule that could make things hard for a character."

Writing: The Setting Name — "Type the name of your story's main location and one 'Sensory Anchor' that describes it (like 'the smell of salt water' or 'the hum of old lights')."

Lesson 03: The Big Change
Content: [Foundation: “A story begins when something happens that changes everything.”]
Every great book has a 'Point of No Return.' We call this the Inciting Incident. It is the 'Big Change' that kicks the story into gear. Imagine your Hero is living their normal life, and suddenly something happens—a mystery begins, or they have to go on a trip. This event forces the Hero to make a Choice.

The world as they knew it is gone, and they can't go back. This Big Change should be linked to the Big Wish we talked about in Lesson 01. If your Hero wants to be brave, the Big Change should be something that scares them! Like a row of dominoes falling, this one event will lead to the next. You are now officially on the path to the end of your book.

Tasks for L03:

Speaking: The Big Change — "What is the one event that changes your Hero's life forever? What happens that makes it impossible for them to go back to their normal life?"

Comprehension: The Choice — "Why is it important that the Hero chooses to take action after the Big Change happens?"

Writing: The First Domino — "Write one sentence about the moment the world changes for your Hero. Start with the words: 'Everything changed when...'"

Lesson 04: People Talking
Content: [Foundation: “Dialogue is not how people actually talk; it is how we wish they talked.”]
In a novel, talking is called Dialogue. Your characters shouldn't talk about the weather; they should talk to get what they want. We use something called Subtext. This is a big word that just means 'the meaning under the words.' If a character is angry but says, 'I'm fine,' the subtext says they are mad. This makes your characters feel smart and deep.

Using VibeScribe is the best way to practice this. When you speak your dialogue out loud, you can hear if it sounds like a real person or a robot. Good dialogue is like a tennis match. Each person is hitting the ball back and forth, trying to 'win' the conversation. When your characters talk with a purpose, the reader feels like they are eavesdropping on a real, exciting moment.

Tasks for L04:

Speaking: The Tennis Match — "Imagine two characters are arguing over a lost key. Speak both parts of the conversation for 60 seconds. Make sure they don't just agree with each other!"

Comprehension: The Under-Words — "In your own words, what is 'Subtext'? Why is it more interesting than a character just saying exactly how they feel?"

Writing: The Unspoken Truth — "Write two lines of dialogue. One character says something nice, but the other character knows they are actually lying."

Lesson 05: The Big Finish
Content: [Foundation: “A great ending isn't a surprise; it's a promise kept.”]
The end of your book is called the Climax. This is the moment where the Hero finally faces their 'Ghost' and tries to get their 'Big Wish' one last time. Everything in the story has been leading to this one big 'Showdown.' A good ending should feel Surprising but Right. You want the reader to gasp, but then think, 'I should have seen that coming!'

After the excitement, we have the Resolution. This is a quiet moment where we see how the world has changed. The Hero might not get exactly what they wanted, but they usually get what they needed. Finishing a novel is a huge achievement. You have proven that you can build a whole world and guide a character through a storm. You are now a Novelist.

Tasks for L05:

Speaking: The Hero's Change — "How is your Hero different at the end of the story compared to the beginning? What did they learn about themselves?"

Comprehension: The Promise Kept — "Why is it important to remember the 'Reader's Promise' when you are writing the end of your book?"

Writing: The Final Image — "Describe the very last thing the reader sees in their mind before they close the book. Is it a sunset? A smile? A closed door?"

After seeding, ensure Catalog 02 is locked unless author_path is set to 'novelist'. Completion of Lesson 05 in this catalog should trigger the 'Specialist' seal in the Author Registry."
