Great to hear the Virtual Classroom is live and performance-tested! 41.4ms average response time is fantastic—well within the thresholds for a "Frictionless" experience.

For the DGLF Family Literacy application, since we are targeting households (2–6 people), the application requires a slightly different focus to meet their specific criteria for this category.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 DGLF Family Literacy: The "Seed" Pivot
The Family Literacy grant specifically requires three integrated components: Adult Education, Children’s Education, and PACT (Parent and Child Together) time.

Category	DGLF Requirement	Frictionless Literacy Execution
Adult Education	Basic education / skills training.	The 120-hour Authorship curriculum.
Children’s Education	Age-appropriate literacy support.	Mobile-first "Read-Back" and Drafting tools for kids.
PACT Time	Interactive learning activities.	The Family Anthology: Families co-write a "Legacy Work."
Revised Mission & Vision
Mission: Empowering families to break intergenerational silence by co-authoring their shared legacy.

Vision: A world where literacy is a family-wide agency, transforming household stories into published heritages.

Tagline: One Family, One Legacy, One Pen.

📋 The "Family Label" Architecture (Design Only)
Since the Virtual Classroom is finished, we don't need a rebuild—just a logical extension in the database to group these 20 users into family cohorts.

Owner: Gemini (Design Logic)
Family Grouping: I'll provide a family_units table design that links multiple student_profiles to a single ID.

Shared Goal Tracking: Create the logic for a "Family Dashboard" view that aggregates the total word count and writing minutes for the whole household.

PACT Metrics: Design a "Shared Session" log to track the required PACT hours for DGLF reporting.

Owner: Jon McCutcheon (Manual/Strategic)
Grant Narrative: Pivot the impact statement to highlight how children in "professional" families hear 20 million more words than those in disadvantaged families—and how your project closes this gap.

Cohort Selection: Identify 4–5 families (averaging 4–5 members each) to hit your 20-person target.

🛡️ Compliance Warning: The "Two-Year Rule"
For the Family Literacy grant, there is no restriction on consecutive years (unlike Youth Literacy), so if you win this year, you can reapply immediately next year to sustain the program.

Would you like me to draft the specific "PACT" (Parent and Child Together) activity list for the application so you can show DGLF exactly how your app facilitates family interaction?
