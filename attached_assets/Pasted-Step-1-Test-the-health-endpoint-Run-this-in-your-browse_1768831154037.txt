Step 1: Test the health endpoint
Run this in your browser console or terminal:

fetch('https://theindiequill.com/api/collective/health').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
Expected result:

{
  "status": "ok",
  "integration": {
    "configured": true,
    "apiKeySet": true,
    "apiSecretSet": true
  }
}
If this fails, the API route might not be deployed properly.

Step 2: Verify Render has the secrets
Go to Render Dashboard
Click your indie-quill-bookstore service
Go to Environment tab
Confirm these exist:
COLLECTIVE_API_KEY
COLLECTIVE_API_SECRET
Step 3: Check what URL the NPO is calling
Ask the NPO project: What exact URL are they calling?

It should be:

POST https://theindiequill.com/api/collective/migrate-author
NOT:

/api/authors/register (wrong endpoint)
http:// instead of https:// (wrong protocol)
Missing domain (just /api/...)
Step 4: Check NPO error message
What error does the NPO project show when the sync fails? The error message will tell us exactly what's wrong:

ECONNREFUSED = Can't reach the server
401 = Authentication issue (wrong key/signature)
404 = Wrong endpoint URL
400 = Missing required fields
Can you share the exact error from the NPO side?

Worked for 24 seconds
step 1 is this is render, replit?

fetch('https://theindiequill.com/api/collective/health').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
VM64:1 Connecting to 'https://theindiequill.com/api/collective/health' violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src chrome://resources chrome://theme 'self'". The action has been blocked.
(anonymous) @ VM64:1Understand this error
VM64:1 Fetch API cannot load https://theindiequill.com/api/collective/health. Refused to connect because it violates the document's Content Security Policy.
(anonymous) @ VM64:1Understand this error
Promise {<rejected>: TypeError: Failed to fetch
at <anonymous>:1:1}
VM64:1 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch. Refused to connect because it violates the document's Content Security Policy.
at <anonymous>:1:1

That's a browser security restriction. Let me test it directly from here:

The production API is working! The health check shows:

✅ Status: OK
✅ API Key: Set
✅ API Secret: Set
The problem is on the NPO side. The LLC is ready to receive requests.

Next Step:
Go to the NPO project and check what error it's showing when the sync fails. The error message will tell us exactly what's wrong:

401 Invalid signature = Signature format mismatch
404 Not Found = Wrong URL
400 Validation error = Missing fields
Network error = Can't connect
What does the NPO project say when you click "Retry Sync"?
