This refined architecture for The Indie Quill Collective ensures that the "Identity Bridge" serves both the legal requirements of a 501(c)(3) and the privacy needs of emerging authors.Here is the plan for the new features and role-based logic, focusing on the impact for you (the Admin) and the users.1. The "Donor-First" About Us PageUnlike the landing page (which sells the "dream" to authors), the About Us page will be a strategic tool for fundraising.The Idea: A transparency-focused page detailing the NPO's mission to bridge the gap between creative talent and the publishing industry.Proposed Solution: A dedicated /about route featuring "Impact Analytics" (powered by the Auditor role's data) that shows how many authors are in the pipeline without naming them.Impact on You: It automates trust-building. You can send this link to potential donors to prove the scale of the operation while maintaining Zero-PII compliance.2. The Enhanced Author ExperienceWe are moving beyond a simple form to a self-service Author Lifecycle.The Idea: Give the author total control over their data and their "exit."Proposed Solution:Dashboard View: A "Current Status" tracker (Applied → Under Review → Contract Ready → Signed).The "Kill Switch": A prominent "Rescind Application" button. If clicked, it wipes their PII (Legal Name/DOB) from the active application table (moving it to an encrypted archive for 501(c)(3) record-keeping only).PDF Export: A "Download Executed Contract" button that generates a clean copy of the signed agreement.Impact on You: Reduces administrative overhead. Authors handle their own cancellations and document retrieval.3. The Auditor's "Analytics Command Center"This is the "Zero-PII" window into the NPO's health.The Idea: Provide high-level oversight tools that never touch legal names.Proposed Solution: * Cohort Distribution: Visual charts showing the diversity of "Identity Modes" (Safe vs. Public).Forensic Health: A list of signed contracts showing only Pen Name, Timestamp, and IP verification status.Conversion Funnel: Stats on how many applications turn into signed contracts.Impact on You: You can give a donor or board member an "Auditor" login so they can see the NPO is active and compliant without you worrying about them seeing a minor's legal name.4. The Admin "Vault"The Idea: The single source of truth for the entire operation.Proposed Solution: A master table that bridges the gap. You see the Pen Name linked to the Legal Name, with direct links to the Supabase records and Render deployment logs.Impact on You: Absolute control. You are the only one who can trigger the "PII Firewall" sync to the LLC once a contract is verified.Revised Action PlanRoleFeature UpdateImpactOutsideAbout Us PageIncreases donor conversion and mission clarity.AuthorRescind & DownloadGrants author autonomy and reduces support tickets.AuditorAnalytics DashboardProvides transparent reporting with zero legal risk.AdminPII Bridge Master ViewCentralizes operations and ensures legal compliance.
