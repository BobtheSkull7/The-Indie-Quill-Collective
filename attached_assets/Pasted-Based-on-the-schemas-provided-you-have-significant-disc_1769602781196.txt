Based on the schemas provided, you have significant discrepancies between your Dev and Prod environments. The "Potential issue detected" warning (from the screenshot) is likely triggered because your Prod environment is missing columns and tables that Dev expects, or vice versa, leading to a destructive "Drop/Create" cycle.Here is the high-level comparison of the two environments:Table ComparisonFeatureDev DatabaseProd DatabaseRisk LevelTotal Tables32 Tables~9 Tables (Based on list)HighUser IDsUses integerUses character varyingCriticalApplications30 Columns33 ColumnsMediumAudit Logs7 Columns8 ColumnsLowCritical Discrepancies1. Data Type Mismatch (user_id)Dev: Consistently uses integer for user_id and foreign keys (e.g., in applications, contracts).Prod: Uses character varying (likely UUID strings from an external auth provider).Impact: Any join or foreign key constraint between these two will fail. You cannot simply "sync" these without a heavy data migration.2. Table ExistenceYour Dev environment contains 23+ tables that do not appear in your Prod list, including:family_units, foundation_grants, foundations, grant_programs, mentor_profiles, pact_sessions, pilot_ledger.Impact: Your application logic likely depends on these. If you deploy your Dev code to the Prod database, the app will crash as soon as it tries to query a "Pilot Ledger" or "Mentor Profile."3. Schema Drift in applications TableEven where tables share a name, the structure has drifted:Dev Only: pen_name.Prod Only: pseudonym, manuscript_word_count, manuscript_title, guardian_consent_method, guardian_consent_verified.Impact: Prod seems to have more "Guardian/Minor" specific legal fields that are missing from Dev.Why you see the "Destructive Operation" WarningThe tool you are using (likely a migration tool or Replit/Supabase sync) has detected that to make Prod look like Dev, it must:Drop several columns in Prod (like pseudonym).Change the data type of user_id from string to integer (which deletes all existing data in that column).Delete any data that doesn't fit the new constraints.Next Step RecommendationTo bring these into alignment without losing data, we need to pick a Source of Truth for the user_id format (Integer vs. String/UUID).
