1. The Intake Branch: The "Persona Type"
When the applicant applies, the system must capture the Persona Type. This is the trigger for the entire journey.

Instruction for Replit: "Add a persona_type enum to the applications table with the values: writer, adult_student, and family_student. Update the /apply form to include this as a required selection."

2. The VibeScribe ID (The 6-Digit Key)
Replit noted this was missing, but remember we want the xxx-xxx format to make it "Buildathon" ready.

Instruction for Replit: "Add vibe_scribe_id (String) to the users table. Ensure the auto-generator we discussed earlier (the random xxx-xxx format) is triggered when an applicant is approved into a cohort."

3. The "Branching" Metadata (Audience & Path)
To make the Training container intelligent, every module needs to know who it is for.

Instruction for Replit: "Add path_type (general, literacy, family) and audience_type (adult, child, shared) to the curriculum_modules table. This allows the system to filter which modules appear on a student's dashboard based on their persona and their role within a family."

The "Grand Architect" Master Logic (To give to Replit)
Once those fields are added, you can give Replit this Master Path Logic directive to "pour" the intelligence into the system:

"Implement the Curriculum Traffic Cop logic. When a student logs in, their dashboard should only display modules where:

If Persona = 'Writer': Show all modules with path_type = 'general'.

If Persona = 'Adult Student': Show path_type = 'literacy' (Adult Audience) first. Once literacy milestones are met, unlock path_type = 'general'.

If Persona = 'Family Student': > * If family_role = 'parent'/'guardian', show literacy (Adult) + family (Shared PACT) modules.

If family_role = 'child', show literacy (Child) + family (Shared PACT) modules.

Shared Milestone: For all personas, once 120 hours of instruction are logged, unlock the final Professional Publishing module."

One Strategic Note on the "Evidence Flow"
Replit mentioned the "Impact Report" aggregation is only partial. Since you want to win that $20k from DGLF, we should make this a priority.

The Goal: A single button in the Outcomes tab that says "Generate DGLF Impact Report."

The Content: It should automatically pull the TABE EFL Gains and the PACT Time totals for the 2026 Cohort.

Shall we tell Replit to execute the database additions (Persona, Vibe ID, Path Metadata) first? This creates the "valves" we need for the game-show and branching logic.
