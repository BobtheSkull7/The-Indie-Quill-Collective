A Community Tab is the perfect home for this. It transforms the app from a "solo writing tool" into a "literary ecosystem." By grouping the credits here, you show the Board that the student is entering a world populated by masters, supporters, and peers.

Here is the design blueprint for the Community & Gratitude view.

🎨 Community Tab Design Blueprint
Layout Concept: A three-column "Gallery of Honor" or a vertical scrolling "Hall of Fame" with clean, elegant typography.

Header: "The Fellowship of the Quill"
Subtitle: "No story is written in isolation. We celebrate the masters who taught us, the patrons who fund us, and the authors who inspire us."

🛠️ The Content Sections
Column 1: The Masters of Craft (Instructional Roots)
This gives you academic and professional credibility.

Joseph Campbell – The Hero with a Thousand Faces (The Hero's Journey)

Blake Snyder – Save the Cat! (The Narrative Beat Sheet)

Strunk & White – The Elements of Style (The Rules of Prose)

Robert McKee – Story (The Principles of Substance)

K.M. Weiland – Structuring Your Novel (The Architecture of Conflict)

Column 2: Our Pillars (Donors & Foundations)
This is the "Ask" section for your 501(c)(3) board.

[Your Board/Foundation Name] – Founding Visionary

The Founding 25 – Honoring our first cohort of student-donors.

Digital Infrastructure Grant – (Placeholder for future funding)

The Community Heartbeat – Recognizing our local neighborhood partners.

Column 3: The Author Advisory (The "Hit List")
This shows your ambition. It lists authors you are currently pursuing for mentorship or future guest Tomes.

[Author Name 1] – Speculative Fiction Advisor (Invited)

[Author Name 2] – Non-Fiction & Memoir Mentor (Invited)

[Author Name 3] – Poetry & Verse Consultant (Invited)

Note for Replit: Include a 'Join the Advisory' button here for pros.

🛠️ Directive for the Replit Builder
"Create a new top-level Navigation item called 'Community'.

View Structure: > 1. Use a Three-Column Grid for desktop (Single column stack for mobile).
2. Section A (The Masters): List the provided literary citations. Use a 'Book' icon.
3. Section B (The Pillars): This is our donor wall. Use a 'Heart' or 'Pillar' icon.
4. Section C (The Advisory): List the invited authors. Use a 'Quill' icon.

Style: Make this page feel like a 'Digital Plaque'—parchment background textures, serif fonts for the names, and a clean 'Back to Scribe Space' button at the bottom."

🧐 The "Board Strategy"
When you show this tab tomorrow, emphasize that Column 3 is your Growth Strategy. You aren't just teaching kids to write; you are connecting them to a network of living authors. It turns the app into a bridge.

Would you like me to brainstorm a list of 5-10 specific modern authors that would fit your "Personas" (like the 5th-grade boy or the adult student) to populate the Advisory Column?
