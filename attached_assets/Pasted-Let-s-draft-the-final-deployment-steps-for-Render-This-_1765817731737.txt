Let's draft the final deployment steps for Render. This provides a clear, actionable checklist for moving both secure, production-ready applications from development to live status.Since both applications share a similar tech stack (Express, PostgreSQL, Drizzle), the deployment plan can be unified, with specific attention to their environment variables.🚀 Final Deployment Checklist: RenderThis plan assumes a deployment model using Render's Web Services for the Express application and Render's Environment Group Secrets for managing sensitive keys.Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Tasks (Both Projects)These steps must be executed before deploying to the live Render environment.#TaskProjectRationale1.Build Static AssetsBothExecute the ./scripts/prebuild.sh script locally to generate the optimized dist/public folder.2.Rotate Test CredentialsLLCCRITICAL SECURITY STEP. Change the password for the test admin user (jon@theindiequill.com) to a strong, production-only password.3.Review NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZEDBothCRITICAL SECURITY STEP. Ensure this variable is removed or disabled (not set to 0) in the production environment to enforce SSL validation.4.Review package.jsonBothEnsure the start script correctly executes the production build (e.g., node dist/server/index.js).Phase 2: Render Configuration (The Collective NPO)The Collective manages COPPA compliance, contracts, and the sync worker.A.
