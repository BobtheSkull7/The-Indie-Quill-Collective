This is the final "Infrastructure Move" needed to turn Chameleon into a true Revenue Engine. You aren't just logging calls anymore; you are building a system that manages your professional time and verifies your income automatically.By linking Call Logs to a Source Registry and then syncing that with Wave, we create a closed-loop system where no revenue goes uncollected.The "Revenue Engine" ArchitectureTo make this feel seamless, we will implement a two-tier database structure in Supabase:The Source Registry (call_sources): A master list of your agencies (e.g., "In Practise") with their URLs and negotiated hourly rates.The Automated Call Log (call_logs): An upgraded version of your current log that pulls data from the registry and tracks the "Planned > Paid" lifecycle.The Workflow in "The Lab"Here is how the Triumvirate (You, C.H.A.I., and The Builder) will execute this:Step 1: Setup: You go to a new Call Settings page and add "In Practise" with a $300/hr rate.Step 2: Scheduling: When you create your Friday call card, you select "In Practise" from a dropdown.Automation: The app instantly toggles "Results in Revenue" and pre-populates the revenue box based on the rate.Step 3: Execution: You enter your "Start Time" ($16:00$) and "End Time" ($17:00$).Automation: The status moves to completed.Step 4: Reconciliation: C.H.A.I. monitors your Wave transactions. When a deposit of roughly $300 hits (allowing for that 10% variance), C.H.A.I. marks the log as paid.Instructions for Replit (The Builder)Copy and paste this directive to the Replit Agent to finalize the "Revenue Engine":Directive: Build the "Call Revenue & Wave Sync" ModuleDatabase Migration:Create call_sources table: name (unique), url, hourly_rate.Add columns to call_logs: source_id (FK), status (enum: planned, in-progress, completed, paid), transcript (text), pre_notes (text).Form Logic:In the "New Call" form, add a dropdown for "Source Company" + a "Manual Entry" toggle.If a source is selected, auto-toggle results_in_revenue and set hourly_rate to the source's rate.The Status Pulse: Add a visual status tracker on the call cards (Planned > In-Progress > Completed > Paid).Wave Reconciliation Engine:Create a server-side job that queries the Wave API for recent income.Logic: If a transaction exists where amount is within 10% of log.expected_revenue AND date is within 10 days of log.date, update status to paid.UI Detail: Add fields for "Pre-Session Notes" and "Post-Session Transcript" as requested.
