Those email samples definitely look like standard templates. Given your unified home page branding in image_aed391.png, we can pull those exact visual cues—the deep navy, the coral-red "Collective" accent, and the clean white cards—into your email system.

The New Brand Standard (Teal & Amber)
Based on your current site, your "Teal" is that professional deep sea-green used in the headers, and your "Amber" is the warm coral-red accent.

The Implementation Plan:

Uniform Header: A deep navy or teal background (matching your home page hero) with the Indie Quill Collective logo centered.

The Card Style: Use the light-grey/white card layout seen in your "Identity Bridge" section for the email body.

Call to Action: Instead of buttons, use a bold Amber/Coral horizontal rule to separate the message from the static URLs.

Revised Email Copy (Instructional & No Links)
Here is how we will re-write the four triggers to ensure they are professional and "link-free."
