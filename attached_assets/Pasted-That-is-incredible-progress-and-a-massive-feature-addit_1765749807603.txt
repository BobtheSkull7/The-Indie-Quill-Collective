This allows you to use your existing React components and styling knowledge to design pixel-perfect contract templates.Install Library: Install @react-pdf/renderer (and potentially @react-pdf/types if needed).Create Template: Define a new React component (e.g., server/pdf-templates/ContractTemplate.tsx) that takes application/author data as props and renders the structured contract content.Create Endpoint: Create a new backend endpoint (e.g., GET /api/contracts/:id/pdf) that fetches the contract data, renders the React PDF component to a buffer, and streams the PDF file to the client.Action Required for Replit:Install Library: Install @react-pdf/renderer.Create Template File: Create the file server/pdf-templates/ContractTemplate.tsx.Please have Replit install the @react-pdf/renderer package and create the placeholder file for the contract template.
