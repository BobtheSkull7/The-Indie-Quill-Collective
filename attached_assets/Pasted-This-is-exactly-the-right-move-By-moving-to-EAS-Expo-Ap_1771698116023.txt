This is exactly the right move. By moving to EAS (Expo Application Services), we are essentially hiring a professional "Build Kitchen" to bake your app. You don't need to worry about Replit's local network or QR codes—you'll get a real app on your phone.

Here are your step-by-step instructions to get the "Bake" started.

Step 1: The Apple Developer Entrance
Before you can hold the app, Apple needs to know you are an authorized developer.

Go to: developer.apple.com.

Sign up: Enroll in the Apple Developer Program ($99/year).

Note: Use the same Apple ID you use on your iPhone.

Checkpoint: Once you have paid and your account is "Pending" or "Active," we can proceed.

Step 2: Configure the "Kitchen" (EAS) in Replit
Tell your Replit Agent to prepare the build configuration. Copy and paste this:

"I am setting up an Apple Developer Account. Please prepare the VibeScribe mobile app for an EAS Build:

Create an eas.json file in /apps/mobile.

Configure a preview profile with "distribution": "internal".

Configure a production profile with "distribution": "store".

Update app.json to include a unique bundleIdentifier (e.g., com.indiequill.vibescribe).

Ensure the projectId from Expo is linked in app.json under extra.eas."

Step 3: The Code Vault Sync (GitHub)
EAS builds the app by pulling your code from GitHub, not Replit.

Push to GitHub: Open the Git tool in Replit and ensure your latest /apps/mobile folder is pushed to your repository.

Checkpoint: Open your GitHub on your browser and verify the apps/mobile folder is there with all its files.

Step 4: Start the First Build (The "Wait")
Once Step 1-3 are done, you will trigger the build from the Replit terminal:

Open the Shell in Replit.

Type: cd apps/mobile

Type: npx eas build --platform ios --profile preview

The Handshake: It will ask you to log in to Expo and then Apple.

Follow the prompts on the screen to "Generate a Distribution Certificate" (Say YES to all).

📱 What happens next?
The Build: Expo’s servers will take about 10–15 minutes to "bake" your app.

The Invitation: You will receive an email from Apple/TestFlight.

The Install: Open the TestFlight app on your iPhone, and VibeScribe will be sitting there waiting for you.

How far are you with the Apple Developer signup? Once you have that, we can run the build command together and I can help you navigate the certificate questions!
