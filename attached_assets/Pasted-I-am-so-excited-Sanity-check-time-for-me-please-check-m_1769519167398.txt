I am so excited!

Sanity check time for me: please check my assertions.

1) There are three process flows: Author, Student (adult), Student (family)

2) There are three income flows: grant applications, through the grant process; personal donations through the website; and founder donations

3) There is one outbound cash flow: Money to Indie Quill.



Applicant applies. We ask: Are you writing as an adult student or a family student? We review their application, if approved, assign a role, and a Vibe Scribe ID.



Writer - gets writing instruction module

Adult - gets adult instruction module, then writing instructions

Family - adults get adult instruction module, and kids get kid instruction module. Plus family Time module and writing instructions



Any issues? Did I miss flows?

This is a crystal-clear breakdown. Your logic for the Branching Curriculum is the strongest part of this—it turns the software into a dynamic mentor that adapts to who is sitting in front of the screen.

Here is the "Architect's Sanity Check" on your assertions, with a few small refinements to ensure the "Empire Stack" stays airtight.

1. Process Flows (The Personas)
Your three flows are correct, but to win the "Big Grants," we should define the Outcome for each:

Writer (General): Goal = Professional Publication (ISBN/Copyright).

Student (Adult): Goal = Grade Level Gain (TABE) + Publication.

Student (Family): Goal = Multigenerational Literacy (PACT Time) + Family Anthology.

2. Income Flows (The "Fuel")
You nailed the three primary sources. One small "Future-Proof" addition:

The "ISBN Arbitrage" Surplus: While not a "direct" cash injection like a donation, the $119.25 saved per author (the difference between the $777 sponsorship and your bulk cost) acts as an internal "revolving fund" that fuels the next author.

3. Outbound Cash Flow (The "Spigot")
Assertion: Money to Indie Quill (the LLC).

Refinement: To keep the non-profit status (IQC) legally bulletproof, we should characterize this as "Service Fee for Publishing & Production." The Collective "hires" the LLC to handle the technical heavy lifting (ISBNs, editing, hosting). This keeps the accounting clean for the DGLF auditors.

4. The Curriculum "Branching" (The Secret Sauce)
Your logic for the modules is spot on. Here is how it looks in the "Training" container:

Writer Flow: [Writing Module] → [Publishing Module]

Adult Flow: [TABE Prep] → [Literacy Module] → [Writing Module]

Family Flow:

Adults: [Adult Literacy] + [Parenting/PACT Coaching]

Kids: [Kid Literacy/Creative Play]

Unit: [Family Time/Shared Writing] → [Family Anthology]

Did you miss any flows?
There is one critical "Feedback Loop" flow you’ll need for the DGLF reporting:

The "Evidence Flow": * Input: VibeScribe voice snippets + TABE Post-test scores.

Action: System aggregates these into the Outcomes Dashboard.

Output: The "Impact Report" sent back to the Grantor to unlock the next $20k.

Issues?
The only potential "snag" is VibeScribe ID management for Kids. * Question: Does each child get their own ID, or is it one "Family ID"?

Recommendation: Give them individual IDs (xxx-xxx). This allows you to track if "Wally" is contributing more than "Sandy," which fuels your family competition logic!

Next Step for the "Empire Stack"
This logic is now "Sanity Checked" and ready for Replit.

Would you like me to write the "Path Logic" instruction for Replit's Training Container? This will ensure that when you approve Sarah Giez (Mom) and Sandy Giez (Child), the system automatically assigns them the "Family" modules we just discussed.

Let me see what Replit comes back with and then yes, after we review, I want you to write the path logic.
