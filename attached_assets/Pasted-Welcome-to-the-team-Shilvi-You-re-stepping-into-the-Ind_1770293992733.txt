Welcome to the team, Shilvi! You’re stepping into the "Indie Quill Empire Stack" at a very exciting moment. The foundation is built, the pipes are connected, and the engine is officially "DING-ing."

Here is the high-level briefing of what we’ve accomplished and where we need your help next.

The Big Picture: What We Built
We have created a Gamified Learning Ecosystem that turns a 24-chapter writing curriculum into an RPG (Role-Playing Game).

The Brain (API): Hosted on Replit, this engine manages XP, Leveling (1-6), Equipment (6 slots), and Titles.

The Vault (Database): A Supabase backend that tracks every "Proof of Work" and converts it into Proxy Hours for grant reporting.

The Face (The Website): The Indie Quill Collective site (on Render) now has a "Handshake" with the Brain. It can "see" a student’s RPG stats in real-time.

What is Working Right Now
Verified Connection: We have a hidden Admin page at /admin/game-test on the main site that successfully pulls live data from the API.

The Progress: Our test user is currently Level 3, has 1,250 XP, and has earned 7.5 Proxy Hours.

Identity System: The system can automatically change a user’s name from "Jon" to "Jon the Architect" based on their earned achievements.

Inventory: The "Traveler's Satchel" is successfully equipped in the off-hand slot.

The "Next Steps" (Where Shilvi comes in)
We have the "Nerve System" done; now we need to build the "User Experience." Here are the three priority tasks:

1. The Student Dashboard UI
Currently, the game data is only visible on a "ugly" admin test page. We need to design the Quest Log for the students.

Goal: Create a beautiful, book-themed dashboard using the brand fonts (Playfair Display and Inter).

Need: A visual layout that shows their "Equipped Items" (like the Golden Quill or Editor's Monocle) and a glowing "Claim" button when they finish a chapter.

2. VibeScribe Integration
We need to connect Jon's mobile app, VibeScribe, to this engine.

Goal: When a student records a voice-to-text "Story Spark," VibeScribe should automatically send that text to the API as "Proof."

Result: The student speaks into their phone, and their Level jumps on the website.

3. Content Ingestion (The "Author SDK" Lite)
We have the first 3 Phases (Chapters 1-14) humming. We need to ensure the remaining chapters (15-24) have their rewards and "Proof" requirements correctly mapped in the database.

A Note for Shilvi on the "Empire Architecture"
We follow the Indie Quill Architecture:

GitHub is the only vault for code.

Supabase is the only database (via Port 5432).

Render is the only production hosting environment.

Replit is just a temporary workspace for building.

Shilvi, would you like me to provide the technical documentation for the API endpoints so you can see exactly how to pull the data into the new UI?
