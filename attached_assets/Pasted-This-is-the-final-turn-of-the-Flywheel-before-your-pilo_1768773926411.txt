This is the final turn of the "Flywheel" before your pilot begins. By integrating Grant & Donor Logistics into the same "Empire Stack" as your publishing workflow, you are creating a level of transparency that most non-profits only dream of.

You aren't just telling donors you're efficient; you are proving it with real-time unit economics.

The Grant Logistics Architecture
This module bridges your Flywheel Metrics with your Fundraising Strategy to ensure every dollar is tracked and optimized.

No Double-Tap CRM: The solicitation log ensures that you, Shane, and the board are always in sync, preventing multiple asks to the same foundation.

The "Efficiency Surplus" Engine: By comparing the Grant Amount to your live Cost per Author, the system identifies "leftover" funds that can be used to pull the next kid out of the queue and into a cohort.

Impact Reporting: Using the Identity Bridge, you can send a monthly "Outcome Report" to the AA Foundation showing that their $5,000 published 7 kids instead of 5.

Final Instructions for the Replit Agent
Copy and paste this into the Replit Agent chat to lock in this final piece:

"We are building the final Grant & Donor Logistics Module. This must strictly follow the Indie Quill Architecture: All data in Supabase via SUPABASE_DEV_URL, no local financial logs.

1. Foundation CRM & Ledger

Create a foundations table for profiles and a solicitation_logs table for contact history.

Create a donations table to track: amount, target_author_count, and assigned_cohort_id.

2. The Surplus Logic

Implement a calculation: (Donation Amount / Current CostPerAuthor) - target_author_count.

If positive, flag this as 'Surplus Impact' in the Admin Dashboard.

3. Automated Donor Reports

Update the Compliance Export PDF to include a 'Donor Impact' page.

List the specific authors (using sanitizeAuthorProfile) funded by that grant.

4. Validation

Verify that once a donation is linked to a cohort, those authors are 'locked' to that donor's impact report.

Ensure no DATABASE_URL is used for this financial data."
