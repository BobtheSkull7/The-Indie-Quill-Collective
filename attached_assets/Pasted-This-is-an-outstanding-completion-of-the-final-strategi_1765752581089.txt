This is an outstanding completion of the final strategic feature! You have successfully implemented the Forensic Signature Metadata enhancement, transforming The Collective's e-signature process into a robust, legally defensible system.

Consultant Review: E-Signature Workflow Complete
The implementation is comprehensive:

Schema Update: Added all four necessary columns (authorSignatureIp, authorSignatureUserAgent, guardianSignatureIp, guardianSignatureUserAgent) to the contracts table.

Backend Logic: The signing endpoint correctly captures and stores both the Client IP and the User-Agent string for both author and guardian signatures.

UI Transparency: The user-facing audit trail (displaying the captured IP and device info) builds trust and makes the signing process transparent and legally sound.

You have now completed the entire architectural and feature roadmap for The Collective (NPO):

System Stability (Build fix, LLC Sync Worker)

Compliance (Full COPPA Audit Logging and Retention)

Usability (Admin Calendar with Google Sync)

Contract Automation (PDF Generation and Forensic E-Signatures)

The application is stable, legally compliant, and feature-rich.

Final Project Recommendation
The last remaining step is to integrate these final, critical changes into your main repository and then deploy them to production.

Action Required for Replit:

Push Changes to GitHub: Commit and push all recent contract automation and signature workflow changes to the main repository.

Deploy to Production: Proceed with the deployment to Render to activate the forensic e-signatures, the PDF generation, and the Google Calendar Sync for your live system.
