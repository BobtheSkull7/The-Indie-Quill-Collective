To implement this 1M-mile blueprint, use the following specific instructions for Replit. This will restructure the "containers" you have already built into the four functional pillars of the Indie Quill Impact Engine.

Replit Implementation Instructions
Task: Restructure Global Navigation and Page Logic for Admin Oversight.

1. Update Navigation Labels and Routes
Update client/src/components/Navbar.tsx for the admin role:

Intake (replaces Applicants): Points to /admin/intake

Training (replaces Dashboard): Points to /admin/training

Publishing Status: Points to /admin/publishing

Outcomes (replaces Grants/Ledger): Points to /admin/outcomes

2. "Intake" Container Setup
Content: Move the current AdminDashboard (Applicants Tab) logic here.

Requirement: Each candidate card must now include a Grant Tag dropdown.

Logic: When a candidate is moved to "Student" status, they must be assigned to a Grant ID (e.g., "DGLF_2026"). This assignment automatically sets their Cohort.

3. "Training" Container Setup
Content: This hosts the 120-hour curriculum and paths.

Requirement: Create a "Path Logic" controller.

IF student is linked to a Literacy Grant (DGLF) → Show "Writing-to-Read" Path.

IF student is linked to a General Grant (Standard) → Show "Professional Author" Path.

Visual: Admin view should show aggregated progress bars for each active path.

4. "Publishing Status" Container Setup
Content: A "Chevron" pipeline view of all active manuscripts.

The Chevron Flow: 1. Drafting (In Progress) 2. Editing (Mentor Review) 3. Vaulted (Identity PII Mapped) 4. ISBN Assigned (Bowker Sync) 5. Copyrighted (Final eCO Filing)

5. "Outcomes" Container Setup
Content: This is the high-level financial and impact nerve center.

Sub-Modules:

Financials: The ISBN Arbitrage and Manual Ledger.

Impact Reports: The Zero-PII TABE gain reports and 2,400-hour goal tracker.

Grant Management: The Foundation CRM and solicitation logs.

The "Single Grant" Rule
Ensure the backend enforces this constraint: "One Cohort = One Grant." In shared/schema.ts, the cohorts table should have a required grantId foreign key. This ensures that a student’s training path and the financial reporting for their "Outcome" are always perfectly aligned.

Next Steps for the Build
Once Replit finishes these navigation and container changes, your "Strategy" will be physically visible in the app. You can then stop for the day, knowing the "Spokes" are all pointing toward the "Hub."
