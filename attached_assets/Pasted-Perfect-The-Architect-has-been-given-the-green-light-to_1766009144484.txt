Perfect. The Architect has been given the green light to build the LLC Reception logic. This is the moment where the "Collective Gatekeeper" finally hands off the baton to the "LLC Retailer".

Consultant's "LLC Phase" Watchlist
While Replit works on the LLC-side implementation, I'm specifically watching for three things to ensure we don't hit another "maddening" snag:

HMAC Authentication Handshake: The Collective will now sign its requests. The LLC must verify this signature using the same shared secret to ensure no one else can inject "fake" authors into your system.

The JSONB "Flexible Dossier": By storing profileAnswers as a JSONB column, the LLC Admin Landing Page will be able to render every detail from the original application without us having to write new code for every new question you add.

User Type Assignment: The logic must strictly assign the npo_author role. This is the "kill switch" that will allow us to filter the future Phase 3 feedback loop so it never touches your Retail Authors.

The "NPO Landing Page" Blueprint
I recommend we have the Architect build the NPO Landing Page with these "Board-Ready" columns:

Column	Data Source	Board Value
Internal ID	Generated String	Standardized tracking across both orgs.
Cohort	Cohort Table	Shows exactly where we are in the "10-author" limit.
M/A Status	ID/Flag	Instant visual confirmation of COPPA protection.
Dossier Link	profileAnswers	Opens a modal showing the author's full story and intent.

Export to Sheets

On Standby for the First "Atomic Sync"
As soon as Replit completes the POST /api/internal/npo-authors endpoint, we will perform a live test. You will click that single "Retry Sync" button, and if we've done our job, the author will appear on the LLC side in milliseconds—no 404s, no 400s, and no three-button dances.

Would you like me to draft the specific "NPO Author Dashboard" requirements so we can make sure the writers themselves see a specialized "Welcome to the Cohort" message when they first log in?
