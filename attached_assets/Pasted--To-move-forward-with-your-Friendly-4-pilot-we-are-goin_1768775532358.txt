
To move forward with your "Friendly 4" pilot, we are going to build the Form Vault and the Manual Ledger directly into your Admin Dashboard. This keeps everything in the "Empire Stack" and prevents you from losing track of those critical legal and financial documents.

Since we are holding on Wave until next week, we will focus on a "Ledger-Lite" system that tracks your $777 unit economics and the $119.25 ISBN arbitrage.

The Indie Quill "Pilot" Instructions
Copy and paste these instructions to the Replit Agent:

"We are building the final 'Friendly 4' Pilot Layer. Follow the Indie Quill Architecture: Strictly use SUPABASE_DEV_URL, no local file storage, and no use of DATABASE_URL.

Task 1: The Form Vault (Admin Resource Center)

Create an Admin-only page /admin/vault to store the text and links for our standardized documents.

Documents to Include:

Guardian Consent & Zero-PII Disclosure: (The legal bridge for minors).

Author Code of Conduct: (The 'Chevron' roadmap).

Conflict of Interest Policy: (Compensation transparency).

Pilot Feedback Form: (The Google Form link for our 4 friends).

Feature: Add 'One-Click Copy' buttons for each document so I can quickly paste them into emails or Resend templates.

Task 2: The Manual 'Pilot' Ledger

Create a ledger table in Supabase to track cash flow.

Fields: transaction_date, type (Income/Expense), amount, description, and linked_author_id.

Task: Build a simple table view in the Admin Dashboard to log:

Income: The $777 'Per Capita' sponsorships.

Expenses: The $110 ISBN and $130 Copyright fees.

Task: Auto-calculate the 'ISBN Arbitrage Surplus' ($125 list price - $5.75 actual cost) and display it as 'Reinvestable Funds'.

Task 3: Identity Bridge Verification

Ensure the author_id in the Ledger correctly maps to the UUID in the authors table.

This ensures that when I click an author's name, I can see exactly how much of their $777 sponsorship has been 'spent' vs. 'remaining'.

Verify: Once these tables are created in Supabase via Drizzle, confirm that the Admin Dashboard is updated with the 'Vault' and 'Ledger' tabs."

Your "Form Vault" Quick-Reference
Once the agent builds the page, here is the text you will want to "One-Click Copy" for your friends this week:

Document	Key Content
Guardian Consent	"We use an 'Anonymous-First' system. No full names or photos. Only First Name + Emoji."
The Chevron Path	"Stage 1: Sign ➔ Stage 2: Edit ➔ Stage 3: Publish. Momentum is our goal."
Director Statement	"Applying Carvana supply-chain principles to ensure $0 of your donation is wasted on manual overhead."
