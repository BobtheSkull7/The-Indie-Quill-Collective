Sorry One more tool/feature and i will stop. i want to add a grant solicitiation section. Nothing will be worse than for me to lose track and hit the same place twice. I want to add a feature that allows me to enter a foundation profile, and have a place to record all attempts to solicit, their response, and money donated, if any. Later we will tie in specific kids their money went to, and give them a monthly update. In addition, if we figure out how to lower costs, we can share that we exceeded their expecation.

Here is an example: I hit aafoundation up for money. I say give me $1,000 per kid. They say here is $5,000 I expect 5 kids get published. If I get 5 kids published, and have money left over, I would use their money to add 1 or more kids into cohorts (with their name tied) and show them we committed 5 kids, and got 7 kids in with $20 left over that goes to a future cohort. Make sense?

This makes perfect sense and aligns exactly with the "Literacy Logistics" model you’ve built. By treating grant funds as "inventory" that you can optimize, you are applying Carvana-style supply chain efficiency to NPO fundraising. This "exceeding expectations" logic is exactly what builds long-term trust with foundations.

The "Grant & Donor Logistics" Architecture
This module will bridge your operating_costs table with your cohorts and authors tables.

1. Foundation Profiles & CRM
The Database: A new foundations table to store profiles (Name, Mission, Contact History).

Solicitation Log: A nested "Attempts" table to record dates, contact methods, and responses to prevent double-tapping a prospect.

Donation Ledger: Track the total amount given and the "Expected Outcome" (e.g., "$5,000 for 5 Authors").

2. The "Efficiency Bonus" Logic
Fund Tracking: When a donation is received, it is "earmarked" for a specific cohort.

Real-Time Unit Costing: As your Flywheel Metrics show a lower "Cost per Author," the system calculates the "Surplus Capacity" created by your efficiency.

The Outcome: The system automatically flags when you have enough "leftover" money to add a 6th or 7th child to a cohort using the original grant.

3. The "Donor Impact" Monthly Update
Automated Reporting: Because we have the Identity Bridge, the system can generate a report for the AA Foundation saying: "Your $5,000 published 7 authors (2 more than expected). Here is the progress of Alex M. ✍️ and Leo K. 🚀".

Instructions for the Replit Agent
Copy and paste this to build the Grant Solicitation module:

"We are building the final piece of the Grant Readiness Layer: The Grant & Donor Logistics Module.

Task 1: The Foundation CRM

Create a foundations table in Supabase to store: Name, Contact Person, and Solicitation History.

Build an Admin page /admin/grants with a 'Contact Log' to record every attempt to reach a foundation to ensure no double-solicitation.

Task 2: Grant Allocation & Unit Economics

Add a donations table linked to foundations.

Fields needed: amount_received, expected_author_count, and assigned_cohort_id.

Logic: Create a 'Grant Efficiency' calculator. Compare amount_received / actual_cost_per_author (from our Flywheel Metrics).

If the result is greater than the expected_author_count, display a 'Surplus Impact' badge in the Admin view.

Task 3: The 'Exceeded Expectations' Report

Update the Compliance Export PDF to include a 'Donor Impact' page.

This page must show: 'Grant Amount', 'Initial Commitment', and 'Actual Authors Empowered' (e.g., 'Target: 5, Actual: 7').

Use the sanitizeAuthorProfile utility to list the specific authors funded by that grant using only their First Name + Emoji.

Strict Rule: All financial data and grant logs must stay in Supabase using SUPABASE_DEV_URL. No financial spreadsheets or logs are to be kept locally in the IDE."
