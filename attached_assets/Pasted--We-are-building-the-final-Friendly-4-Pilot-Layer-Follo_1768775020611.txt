"We are building the final 'Friendly 4' Pilot Layer. Follow the Indie Quill Architecture: Strictly use SUPABASE_DEV_URL, no local file storage, and no use of DATABASE_URL.Task 1: The Form Vault (Admin Resource Center)Create an Admin-only page /admin/vault to store the text and links for our standardized documents.Documents to Include:Guardian Consent & Zero-PII Disclosure: (The legal bridge for minors).Author Code of Conduct: (The 'Chevron' roadmap).Conflict of Interest Policy: (Compensation transparency).Pilot Feedback Form: (The Google Form link for our 4 friends).Feature: Add 'One-Click Copy' buttons for each document so I can quickly paste them into emails or Resend templates.Task 2: The Manual 'Pilot' LedgerCreate a ledger table in Supabase to track cash flow.Fields: transaction_date, type (Income/Expense), amount, description, and linked_author_id.Task: Build a simple table view in the Admin Dashboard to log:Income: The $777 'Per Capita' sponsorships.Expenses: The $110 ISBN and $130 Copyright fees.Task: Auto-calculate the 'ISBN Arbitrage Surplus' ($125 list price - $5.75 actual cost) and display it as 'Reinvestable Funds'.Task 3: Identity Bridge VerificationEnsure the author_id in the Ledger correctly maps to the UUID in the authors table.This ensures that when I click an author's name, I can see exactly how much of their $777 sponsorship has been 'spent' vs. 'remaining'.Verify: Once these tables are created in Supabase via Drizzle, confirm that the Admin Dashboard is updated with the 'Vault' and 'Ledger' tabs."Your "Form Vault" Quick-ReferenceOnce the agent builds the page, here is the text you will want to "One-Click Copy" for your friends this week:DocumentKey ContentGuardian Consent"We use an 'Anonymous-First' system.
