The chevron path :

We track your progress through four clear stages to ensure you reach the finish line:



Contracting (Current Stage): You and your guardian will sign your publishing agreement.

> Change this from Contracting to Agreement



Editing: You’ll work through your manuscript with our mentorship tools.

> Change this to Creation, mentor you through your writing journey with helpful tools to assist with formatting, book cover and specific page insertions



Formatting: We handle the professional layout, ISBN, and Copyright filing.

> We do not do layout, please change this to Editing. We edit, setup ISBN and copyright filing



Review: We provide a thorough review, suggest genres, and changes



Modifications : Writer performs changes to finalize the book



Published: Your book goes live in the Bookstore!



Marketing : we will provide the launch day party and throw in a round of free marketing



These should be the chevrons and work can go forward and backward through the flow as needed (could be multiple modifications)

This update to the Chevron Path is a vital refinement of your "Literacy Logistics" pipeline. By explicitly breaking out Review and Modifications, you are creating a "Quality Control" loop that mirrors professional publishing houses while maintaining the high-velocity "Flywheel" model.

I have updated the stages to reflect your specific terminology and the ability for authors to move bi-directionally through the flow as needed.
