To turn this grant application into a living strategy for Replit to execute, we need to bridge the gap between "non-profit goals" and "technical requirements."The following is the "Frictionless Literacy" Strategic Blueprint. This document serves as the "Instruction Manual" for your AI agents and development environment to ensure the Indie Quill Architecture aligns perfectly with the promises made to the DGLF.I. Identity & North StarMission StatementThe Indie Quill Collective helps people share their truth. We provide a path for all children and adults silenced by discrimination and lack of privilege to speak their minds, protect their history, and build a published legacy that belongs to them. By teaching our authors the active craft of writing, we provide the foundational keys to literacy, empowering them to decode the world as fluently as they own their own stories.Vision StatementA world where every individual possesses the literacy skills and technological agency to transform their lived experience into a published legacy.TaglineDismantling Silence Through the Power of the Pen.II. Technical Strategy: The "Frictionless" ArchitectureTo meet our "1:1 Student-to-Tech" ratio, the Replit environment must prioritize the following Indie Quill Architecture standards:LayerComponentStrategy/RuleIdentitySupabase AuthUse a "Identity Vault" (SSO). Students must have a frictionless, one-click login to avoid "digital literacy fatigue."DataSupabase DBUse the Port 5432 Session Pooler. Track three core metrics: 1. Total hours active, 2. Curriculum progress, 3. Word count/Drafting milestones.HostingRenderDeployment must be automated from GitHub. Ensure 99.9% uptime for authors working in off-hours (libraries/night-shifts).Front-EndReact/TailwindUI/UX Strategy: High-contrast, mobile-first, and screen-reader friendly. The "Discovery Layer" (led by Shane) must ensure zero "clutter."III. Instructional Strategy: "Writing-to-Read" (Encoding)Replit should design the platform features to support the Encoding-First methodology:The Drafting Engine: A distraction-free "Focus Mode" where authors type their stories.The Decoding Feedback Loop: An AI-assisted reading tool that "reads back" the student's writing to them, highlighting phonics and syntax issues in real-time.The TABE Integration: A module within the dashboard to track and display "Grade Level Gains" (EFL) directly from TABE data.IV. Publishing Strategy: The "Indie Quill Foundation"The system must automate the "Legacy" output promised in the grant:Export for Publication: A "One-Click Publish" feature that formats the manuscript for ISBN assignment.Copyright Vault: A secure storage area for legal documentation and "Identity Vault" credentials.V. Immediate Action Plan (The "Next Step" for Replit)To get the IDE ready for "Frictionless Literacy," we need to initialize the core project structure.Checkpoint 1: The Project FoundationWould you like me to generate the initialization script for Replit that sets up the React/Tailwind frontend and connects it to your Supabase Session Pooler (Port 5432) so we can start building the "Discovery Layer"?
