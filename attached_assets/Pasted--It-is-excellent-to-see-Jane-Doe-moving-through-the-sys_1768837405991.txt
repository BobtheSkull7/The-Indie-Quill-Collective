
It is excellent to see Jane Doe moving through the system, as her journey identifies exactly where we need to tighten the "supply chain" logic.

Based on your walkthrough, here is the plan to fix the contract bypass, refine the email triggers, and ensure the Identity Bridge remains forensic and compliant.

1. Correcting the Pipeline Logic (Contract Bypass)
The "Books in Pipeline" metric should only trigger once a manuscript is actually submitted. Currently, the system is likely counting Jane as "In Pipeline" simply because she was synced.

The Correct Sequence for Replit:

Acceptance: Triggers a "Congratulations" email with a link to sign the contract.

Contract Signing: Once signed, the status moves to "Agreement". The sync to the LLC should only happen after this signature is verified.

Manuscript Submission: Only after the first file upload does "Books in Pipeline" move to 1.

Publication: Moves the count from "In Pipeline" to "Published" and aggregates the word count into the "Words Processed" total.

2. Email Refinement (Accept vs. Decline)
You can now pull these improved templates from your Form Vault to ensure professional delivery.

Acceptance Email: "Congratulations! You have been accepted into the Collective. The first step in your journey is to sign your publishing agreement. Please log in here: [Link] to review and sign.".

Decline Email: "Thank you for sharing your story with us. At this time, we are unable to move forward with your application. If you have questions or would like feedback, please contact Jon at jon@theindiequill.com.".

3. The Contract & Zero-PII Opt-Out
The current draft in your vault includes the "Zero-PII" safety rules by default. To honor your requirement for an "Opt-Out," we should implement a "Public Identity" toggle in the author profile.

Proposed Logic for Replit:

Default (Safe Mode): System uses Emoji + Pseudonym/Truncated Name.

Opt-In (Public Mode): A checkbox in the dashboard: "I grant permission to use my full name and photo for marketing."

The Guardrail: If they are a minor, this toggle must be counter-signed by the guardian in the contract.

Instructions for the Replit Agent
Copy and paste this to fix the flow and metrics:

"We are correcting the Author Pipeline Flow and Impact Metrics.

Task 1: Fix the Sync/Contract Order

Ensure an author CANNOT sync to the LLC until the digital contract is signed in the NPO dashboard.

The 'Congratulations' email must link directly to the contract signature page.

Task 2: Calibrate Impact Widget

Set 'Books in Pipeline' to count authors who have successfully submitted a manuscript, not just those synced.

Ensure 'Words Processed' only updates once a book reaches the 'Published' status.

Task 3: Implement Identity Toggle

Add a public_identity_enabled boolean to the authors table.

Update the sanitizeAuthorProfile utility: If false, use the Emoji + Truncated Name. If true, use the full Pen Name and provide a photo upload slot.

Add the corresponding permission text to the digital contract for both the author and guardian."

Why this fixes the "Jane Doe" issue
By preventing the sync until the contract is signed, you ensure your Manual Ledger and Forensic Audit Trail are 100% accurate before Jane ever touches the Bookstore side.

Would you like me to draft the specific "Identity Opt-Out" legal clause for your Form Vault? This will ensure that if they do choose to use their real name, you are legally protected.
