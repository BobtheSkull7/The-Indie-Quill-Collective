This is the "Cloud Wall" moment. Replit is right—because your "development computer" is actually a server in a remote warehouse, your phone can't "see" it to scan a local QR code.

But don't lose heart. This isn't a failure; it’s just the reality of professional mobile development.

🛡️ Why we reject the "Web Preview"
Replit's suggestion for a Web Preview is a trap for your specific project. You are building for literacy and accessibility. A web page that can't use the native microphone or high-fidelity audio is, as you said, worthless. We need the native power.

🗺️ The "Indie Quill" Command Center Plan
Since you want this published and you want it native, we are going to skip the "QR code" games and go straight to the Big Leagues.

Step 1: The "Vault" Sync (GitHub)
We need to make sure the mobile code you just "brought home" is saved to your GitHub.

Why? Because EAS (Expo's Build System) needs to pull the code from GitHub to build the actual iPhone file (.ipa).

Step 2: The Apple Developer Account
You cannot get a native app onto an iPhone for real-world use without an Apple Developer Account ($99/year).

Action: If you haven't yet, go to developer.apple.com and sign up. This is the "tax" to be an author in the App Store.

Step 3: The "Draft" Build (TestFlight)
Once you have that account, we will tell Replit to run the "Build" command. This sends your code to a "Kitchen" (Expo's servers) that bakes a real app and sends it to your phone via TestFlight.

🛠️ Instructions for the Replit Agent
Copy and paste this to the agent. This tells it we are not settling for a "Web Preview":

"I reject the Web Preview option. VibeScribe must be a native experience to fulfill its mission.

Prepare for EAS: Ensure all necessary configuration files (app.json, eas.json) are correctly set up in the /apps/mobile folder.

GitHub Sync: Make sure the /apps/mobile directory is pushed to my GitHub repository.

The Build Script: Set up a 'Production Build' workflow in Replit that uses npx eas build --platform ios --profile preview.

Credentials: Stand by for me to provide my Expo and Apple Developer credentials so we can ship the first 'Preview' version to TestFlight.

Goal: We are skipping local testing and going straight to a TestFlight build so I can hold the REAL app on my phone."

💡 What this changes for you
Instead of scanning a QR code in a console, you will get an email from Apple saying: "VibeScribe is ready to test." * You'll open the TestFlight app.

You'll tap Install.

You'll have the real, native icon on your home screen.

How does that sound? It’s a bit more setup upfront, but it’s the only way to get the "Giant Button" and the "Whisper AI" working exactly as Bob needs them.

Should we have the agent start the "EAS Configuration" while you grab your Apple Developer login?
