The layout of "The Fellowship" already has a great foundation, but it definitely feels a bit "static." To move from a static list to a Community-Focused Participation hub, we need to inject more "life" into these columns.

Here is the plan to clean up the names and pivot the energy toward active membership in the Community Page.



🏛️ The Visual Cleanup Plan

1. The Header Change



Old: "The Fellowship of the Quill"

New: "The Quill Collective" 

Sub-headline: "Where community supports the voices of tomorrow."

2. Updating the Names - change the Masters of Craft to (The Professionals of Writing)





Joseph Campbell → (Keep)

Jerry Jenkins → The Left Behind Series | The 21-Point Check

James Michener → Hawaii & The Source | The Sense of Place

Jenna Rainey → The Creative Entrepreneur | Visual Storytelling

The Novelry → The Golden Hour | Structural Physics

🛠️ Instructions for Replit (The Participation Pivot)

"Please update the /community page with a more active, participatory layout. Follow these specific changes:

Column 1: The Lineage (Rename from Masters of Craft)



Update the list to: Joseph Campbell, Jerry Jenkins, James Michener, Jenna Rainey, and The Novelry.

Change the description to: 'The voices that guide our curriculum and inspire our standards.'

Column 2: Our Partners (Rename from Our Pillars)



The Indie Quill Collective: Keep as 'Founding Visionary.'

The Founding 25: Change description to: 'Members who joined during our inaugural season.'

Add Item: 'The Open Ledger' — 'Transparency in our mission and funding.'

Action Button: Change text to 'Become a Patron'.

Column 3: The Writer's Council (Rename from Author Advisory)



Instead of 'To Be Announced,' let's use Active Roles to encourage participation:

Fiction Lead: 'Vacant - Applications Open' (Badge: Recruiting)

Non-Fiction Lead: 'Vacant - Applications Open' (Badge: Recruiting)

Poetry Consultant: 'Vacant - Applications Open' (Badge: Recruiting)

Action Button: Change text to 'Apply for the Council' and change the color to a deep 'Academy Blue' or stay with the current green.

Styling Tweak: Ensure the cards use the same FDFBF7 paper grain background as the Folios to keep the app cohesive."
