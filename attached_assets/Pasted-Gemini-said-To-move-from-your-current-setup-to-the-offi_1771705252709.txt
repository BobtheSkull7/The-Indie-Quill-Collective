To move from your current setup to the official Apple App Store, you are entering the "Pro League." Since you already have the $99/year Developer Account, you have the golden ticket.

Here is the exact roadmap and cost breakdown for 2026.

💰 The Financial Reality
Expense	Cost	Frequency
Apple Developer Program	**$99**	Annual
Backend (Render/Supabase)	$0 - $20	Monthly (Free tiers are fine for now)
OpenAI API	Pay-as-you-go	~$0.01 per 2-minute recording
App Store Review	$0	Per submission
Note: Apple takes a 15% cut (via the Small Business Program) only if you sell the app or use In-App Purchases. If the app is free to download and use, you pay Apple $0 beyond your annual fee.

🛠️ The Technical "App Store" Checklist
To be accepted by Apple in 2026, your app must meet these new "Production" standards:

Xcode 26 SDK: Starting April 2026, Apple requires all apps to be built with the iOS 26 SDK. Because you are using EAS, this is easy—EAS handles the "cloud Mac" versions for you.

Privacy Nutrition Label: You must disclose that you collect Audio Data and send it to a third party (OpenAI). You will need a simple website (or a GitHub Page) to host a "Privacy Policy" URL.

AI Disclosure: Since you use LLMs/Whisper, you must include a "consent modal" or a clear note in the app description about how user data is used with AI.

No "Placeholder" Content: Apple will reject the app if they see "Test" buttons or "Bob" as the only user. You'll need to clean up the UI to look like a finished product.

🚀 Step-by-Step Submission Guide
1. Configure for Production
Update your app.json in Replit to include a unique "Bundle Identifier" (like a digital fingerprint).

JSON
{
  "ios": {
    "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourname.indiequill",
    "buildNumber": "1.0.0"
  }
}
2. Run the Production Build
Instead of a "Preview" build, you run the final version:

Bash
cd apps/mobile
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production
3. Upload to App Store Connect
Once the build is done, "ship" it to Apple's dashboard:

Bash
npx eas submit --platform ios
4. The "App Store Connect" Portal
Log in to appstoreconnect.apple.com. You will see your build waiting there. You must:

Upload Screenshots: You need specific sizes for iPhone 16/17 (6.7" and 6.3" displays). Tip: Use a tool like "App Mockup" to make these look pretty.

Set Age Rating: Usually "4+" or "9+" for productivity apps.

Provide a Demo Account: You must give the Apple Reviewer a working Scribe ID (like 618-244) so they can log in and test it.
