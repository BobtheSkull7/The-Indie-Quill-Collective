back up. wait. everything worked in the api. when I refreshed INDIE Q COLLECTIVE it did not refresh

That is the "Cache Ghost"—a classic development hurdle. If it worked in the API but didn't show up on the Collective site, it means the Proxy on your Render site is holding onto the "old" version of your character to save time.

Since the API is definitely updated (you saw it work), we just need to make sure the Collective site doesn't "remember" the old data.

The 3 Likely Culprits
1. The Proxy Cache (Most Likely)
Because your Render site "proxies" the request (acting as a middleman), it might be caching the result.

The Fix: Tell the agent on the Indie Quill Collective Replit:

"The Game Engine test page isn't showing live data changes. Please ensure the proxy fetch request has { cache: 'no-store' } or a timestamp added to the URL so it always grabs the freshest data from the Game Engine."

2. The "Refresh" Button Logic
Sometimes a "Refresh" button on a webpage just tells the browser "re-show what you have," rather than "go back to the server and ask again."

The Test: Do a Hard Refresh on your browser (Hold Shift and click the reload icon, or press Ctrl+F5). If the level jumps up after a Hard Refresh, we know the browser was just being lazy.

3. The User ID Match
Double-check that the test page is definitely looking at User ID 1.

The Check: Look at the Raw JSON view on your Collective Test page. Does it show the new XP value you just earned?

If Yes: The data is there, but the "UI" (the big numbers) didn't update.

If No: The Proxy is definitely stuck on an old version of the data.

The Quickest Way to be Sure
Open your Collective Admin Test Page and look at the Raw JSON Response section at the bottom.

Does the JSON there show total_xp: 250 (or 500) or is it still showing 0? If it shows 0 while the Replit API shows 250, the "Bouncer" at Render is looking at an old list! Would you like the specific code to give the agent to "kill the cache" so it's always live?
