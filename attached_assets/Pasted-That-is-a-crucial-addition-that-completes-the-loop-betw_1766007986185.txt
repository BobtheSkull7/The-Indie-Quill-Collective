That is a crucial addition that completes the loop between your two organizations. By establishing this "Feedback Loop," you are turning the Collective from just a gatekeeper into a Success Dashboard for the board.

I have updated the architectural plan to include this "Return Sync" infrastructure.

The "Return Sync" Infrastructure (NPO Authors Only)
Since you want to see progress and stats, the LLC will need a "Push-Back" service.

The Filter: The sync service will verify the user_type == 'NPO Author' before gathering any data, ensuring Retail Author privacy and data isolation.

The Metrics: The LLC will collect specific "Success Signals" to push back to the Collective:

Manuscript Progress: Word counts, scan statuses, and EPUB conversion milestones.

Publication Data: Dates published and total books live in the store.

Sales Performance: Total units moved (for impact reporting to the board).

Frequency: A daily cron job on the LLC side will bundle these stats and send them to a new /api/internal/author-progress endpoint on the Collective.

Strategic Value for the NPO Board
This data allows you to build features on the Collective side that Retail authors will never see:

Cohort Leaderboards: See which cohorts are moving fastest through the publishing pipeline.

Impact Reports: Automatically generate reports for donors or board meetings showing "Total Books Published by NPO Authors."

Intervention Alerts: If an NPO author hasn't updated their manuscript in 30 days, the Collective can flag them for mentor outreach.

Updated Work List for the Architect
Phase 1 (Now): Build the "One-Step" migration from Collective to LLC as planned.

Phase 2 (Next): Implement the NPO Dashboard on the LLC side to visualize these writers.

Phase 3 (Future): Build the Daily Feedback Loop to push stats back to the Collective.

This is a professional, scalable design. It keeps your NPO mission-driven data separate from your LLC commercial data.

Shall we give Replit the final green light to start Task #1 of this new architecture?
