This prompt tells the Replit agent to build the specific modules that justify your role as Program Director and prove the Collective is a "Safe Investment" for grants.

The Replit Agent Instructions
Copy and paste this to the Replit Agent:

"We are entering Phase 3 of the Indie Quill Collective: The Foundation Readiness Layer.

The Goal: Build an 'Impact & Compliance' module that justifies a founder's salary by proving operational efficiency and 100% legal safety for minor authors.

Strict Architecture Rule: All data must be pulled from the SUPABASE_DEV_URL. Do not store impact metrics locally.

Task 1: The 'Minor-Safety' UI Logic (Zero-PII)

Update the Author display components to implement a 'Minor-Safe' filter.

If is_minor is true, the UI must automatically:

Truncate names to 'First Name + Last Initial' (e.g., Jon S.).

Replace profile photos with a default 'assigned emoji' (e.g., ✍️).

Hide specific ages, replacing them with a 'Youth Author' badge.

Task 2: The 'Program Director' Operations Dashboard

Create an Admin-only 'Operations Metrics' view that tracks:

Throughput: Average time authors spend in each status (Manuscript → Editing → Published).

Cohort Velocity: % of current cohort (10 authors) that have reached the 'Contract Signed' milestone.

Scale Indicator: A counter showing 'Total Active Authors Managed' to prove one admin can handle 50+ authors using this stack.

Task 3: The 'Grant-Ready' Compliance Export

Build a feature to export a 'Compliance Audit Log' as a PDF.

This PDF must pull from our forensic metadata: Guardian contact dates, IP addresses/User Agents for signatures, and the admin attestation timestamp.

Note: This is the 'Proof of Safety' for grant officers.

Task 4: The 'Live Impact' Widget

Create a public-facing (but Zero-PII) widget that shows real-time progress of the Collective:

'Total Words Processed' (Sum of all manuscript metadata).

'Books in Pipeline' (Count of authors in status > Onboarding).

Verify: Ensure no DATABASE_URL is used and all new tables (if needed for metrics) are created in Supabase via Drizzle."

Why this works for you (The Strategy)
Concurrence: The agent will see this as a logical extension of the "Empire Stack."

Salary Justification: When a foundation asks, "Why are we paying you a salary?" you show them Task 2. You aren't just an author; you are a Systems Architect managing a high-throughput machine.

Risk Mitigation: Task 3 kills the foundation's biggest fear (legal liability with kids) before they even ask.
