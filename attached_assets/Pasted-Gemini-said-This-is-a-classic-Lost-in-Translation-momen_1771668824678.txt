This is a classic "Lost in Translation" moment between two different systems. You’ve found the heart of the issue: we are knocking on the front door, but the Game Engine has moved the door to the side of the house.

The fact that it recognizes User 26 as "Not Found" is actually a huge win—it means the bridge is built, we just don't have the keys to the city yet.

🕵️‍♂️ Investigating the Game Engine API
Based on those endpoints, it looks like this engine follows a "Quest-First" logic. Most engines of this type don't have a standalone "Create Character" button; instead, they often auto-create the character the moment the first Quest is started or completed.

Here is how we should direct the Replit agent to solve this puzzle:

"Great detective work on the API endpoints. Since /character/create is a dead end, let's pivot to the Quest Logic the engine clearly prefers:

The 'Stealth' Creation: Try calling /character/status/{user_id} but send a POST request instead of a GET if the user is missing. Some engines auto-provision on the first status check.

The Quest Bridge: Since there's no 'award-xp' endpoint, we will map our Vibe Cards to the Game Engine's Quests.

When Bob 'Absorbs a Tome', call /quest/complete with a payload representing the Tome.

When Bob 'Submits a Manuscript', call /quest/submit/{id} using the Vibe Card ID as the Quest ID.

The Data Discovery: Have the agent write a small script to fetch /rewards/registry. This will tell us what the Game Engine expects to give out. We need to see if it expects specific 'Reward IDs' that we need to match in our Supabase vibe_cards table.

The Fallback: If we still can't find a creation endpoint, let's look at the /quest/complete response. Does completing a quest automatically create the character if they don't exist?

Checkpoint: Once we find the magic call that turns 'User not found' into 'Level 1 Novice', the bridge is fully open."

🛡️ One Critical Thought:
If the Game Engine is an external service (the curriculum-import-tool), we need to make sure we are sending the User ID in a format it likes. Sometimes it wants a username (string) instead of a user_id (integer).

What do you want to do? Should we have the agent try to "Force" a character creation by submitting the first "Welcome Tome" as a completed quest? That is usually the "skeleton key" for these types of RPG engines!

I’m betting that /quest/complete is the secret trigger. Ready to have the agent test that theory?
