To establish a professional Test → QA → Prod pipeline, we need to create a mirrored environment where you can "break" things safely without affecting your real authors or your live login.

The "Mirror Pipeline" Action Plan
Here is exactly what we need to do next to set up this "Safe Passage" workflow:

1. Architect Task: Create Staging Services on Render
The "Test Collective": Create a new Web Service on Render (e.g., staging-collective.onrender.com) linked to the same Git repository but on a staging branch.

The "Test LLC": Create a mirrored LLC service (e.g., staging-llc.onrender.com).

Isolated Databases: Provision two small, separate "Staging" databases in Neon so that test data never mixes with your real January 1st author data.

2. Configuration Task: Environment Variable Handshake
Stripe Test Mode: The Test LLC will use your Stripe Test API Keys and a Test Webhook Secret. This allows you to "buy" books using the 4242 test card numbers for free.

Staging HMAC Secret: We will set a unique STAGING_COLLECTIVE_SECRET so the two test sites can perform the "Atomic Sync" independently of the live ones.

3. Your Task: Domain & URL Discipline
One URL for QA: Once the staging sites are up, you will only use the staging URLs for testing new features.

Browser Isolation: I recommend using a separate browser profile (or a dedicated Incognito window) just for "Test" to prevent the "Invalid Credentials" cookie conflict we saw in your screenshots.

The "Safe Passage" Workflow for January 1st
Once this is set up, your launch preparation looks like this:

Sync Test: You "Accept" a fake author in Test Collective → they appear in Test LLC.

Purchase Test: You "Buy" a book in Test LLC using a Stripe Test Card.

QA Confirmation: You verify the download email arrives in your inbox.

Production Push: Only then do you give the Architect the green light to move that code to Production.

Consultant's Immediate Recommendation
The first step is for the Architect to create the Staging Databases in Neon and the Staging Services in Render. This provides the "ground" for us to build the rest of the pipeline.

Shall I direct the Architect to begin setting up the "Staging Environment" infrastructure now? This will ensure we have a safe place to perfect the "Buy Now" flow today.
