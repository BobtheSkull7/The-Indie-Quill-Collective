Catalog 05: The Poet’s Voice
Description: Mastering rhythm, imagery, and the economy of emotion. Learn to say everything with very little.

Lesson 01: The Image as an Anchor
Content: [Foundation: “A poem is a picture made of words.”]
In poetry, we don't explain feelings; we show them through Images. Instead of saying you are "sad," you might describe "a single cracked teacup on a dusty shelf." This is called an Anchor. It gives the reader something solid to hold onto while they feel the emotions of your poem.

We focus on the Concrete. A concrete word is something you can touch, smell, or see. The more specific the image, the more powerful the poem. You aren't just writing lines; you are painting a scene in the reader's mind, one brushstroke at a time.

Tasks for L01:

Speaking: The Anchor — "Pick an emotion like 'Happiness' or 'Loneliness.' Don't use the word itself. Describe one object that represents that feeling to you."

Comprehension: Showing vs. Telling — "Why is a 'cracked teacup' more interesting to a reader than just saying the word 'sad'?"

Writing: The Image — "Type one sentence describing a weather event (like a storm or a hot day) using only one sensory detail."

Lesson 02: The Music of Words
Content: [Foundation: “Poetry is meant to be heard, not just read.”]
Poetry has a Rhythm, much like a heartbeat or a song. We look at the "Music" of your words—how they sound when they hit the air. Some words are sharp and quick (like 'click' or 'snap'), while others are long and smooth (like 'slumber' or 'glow').

Using VibeScribe is essential here. When you speak your poem, you will hear where the rhythm breaks. You’ll find the natural "bounce" of your lines. We aren't worried about perfect rhyming; we are worried about the Flow. If it feels good to say, it will feel good to read.

Tasks for L02:

Speaking: The Echo — "Read a short phrase three times, changing the speed each time. Notice how the feeling changes when you speak slowly versus quickly."

Comprehension: The Heartbeat — "In your own words, why is the 'sound' of a word just as important as its meaning in a poem?"

Writing: Sound Pairing — "Type two words that sound 'sharp' and two words that sound 'soft'."

Lesson 03: The Power of White Space
Content: [Foundation: “What you leave out is as important as what you put in.”]
On a poem's page, the empty space (the White Space) is part of the art. Where you choose to end a line is called a Line Break. A line break tells the reader when to pause and what word to think about most. It creates "suspense" in the middle of a sentence.

By using less text, you give the words more room to breathe. Every word in a poem has to be "heavy" with meaning because there are so few of them. We practice Word Economy—cutting away everything that isn't the heart of the poem.

Tasks for L03:

Speaking: The Pause — "Speak a sentence, but take a long breath in the middle of it. How does that pause change the meaning of the second half?"

Comprehension: The Breath — "How does a 'Line Break' help a poet control how the reader feels?"

Writing: The Cut — "Take the sentence 'I walked down the long and very lonely street' and remove three words to make it feel like a line of poetry."

Lesson 04: The Unexpected Turn
Content: [Foundation: “A poem should start like a breeze and end like a thunderclap.”]
Similar to a story's twist, a poem often has a Volta or a "Turn." This is a moment where the mood or the topic shifts suddenly. You might start by talking about a flower and end by talking about a memory of your grandmother. This "Turn" is what makes a poem feel deep and surprising.

Tasks for L04:

Speaking: The Shift — "Start by describing something in nature, then suddenly talk about a feeling you had today. Try to connect them in one breath."

Writing: The Turn — "Write two lines: the first line is about a color, and the second line is about a secret."

Lesson 05: The Soul’s Signature
Content: [Foundation: “Your poem is a snapshot of your soul at this exact moment.”]
The final lesson is about Authenticity. There is no "wrong" way to write a poem if it is true to how you feel. Your "Signature" is the unique way you see the world. When you finish this path, you aren't just a writer; you are a Poet who knows how to capture a feeling and keep it forever.

Tasks for L05:

Speaking: The Signature — "What is one thing you see differently than anyone else? Speak about it for 60 seconds."

Writing: The Final Line — "Write the last line of your 'Graduation Poem.' Make it a line that you want to be remembered by."
