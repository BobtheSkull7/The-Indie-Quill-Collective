Collective Database & Environment Architecture1. The Database Split (PostgreSQL)Unlike the Bookstore, which balances Neon and Supabase, the Collective is the administrative "Engine." It manages the logic for syncing data out to external storefronts (like the Bookstore).Production (PostgreSQL): The source of truth for your applications, logic, and sync status. It holds the applications, sync_logs, and identity_bridge_configs.Development (PostgreSQL): A separate instance used for testing sync scripts and "Dry Run" operations.External Links: The Collective database stores the Metadata (like the collective_application_id) that it then pushes to the Bookstore's API.2. Environment Configuration in ReplitThe Collective relies heavily on External API Secrets to talk to the Bookstore.DATABASE_URL: Points to the Collective's specific Postgres instance.BOOKSTORE_API_URL: Must be set to https://theindiequill.com/api for Production and the .replit.app URL for Development.HMAC_SECRET: This is the shared key. It must be identical in both the Collective Secrets and the Bookstore Secrets for the "Identity Bridge" to authorize the request.3. What SHOULD be done in ReplitSync Logic Development: This is where you write the scripts (like test-single-sync.ts) that gather author data and package it for the Bookstore.HMAC Signing: All outgoing requests to the Bookstore must be signed here using the shared secret.Error Logging: Use the Collective's database to log whether a sync to the Bookstore succeeded (201) or failed (500).4. What SHOULD NOT be done in ReplitDirect Database Cross-Talk: The Collective should never connect directly to the Bookstore’s Neon database. It must only communicate via the API (Identity Bridge). This maintains the "Bridge" security.Credential Confusion: Do not mix the Bookstore’s HMAC secret with the Collective’s database password.Untested Bulk Syncs: Never run a full production sync script without first running a "Single Author" test to verify the Identity Bridge is open.Summary Table for the Collective SideFeatureRole / RulePrimary DBPostgreSQL (Internal to Collective)Connection MethodOutbound HTTPS/REST to Bookstore APISecurityShared HMAC Secret (Must match Bookstore)Data FlowPushes to Bookstore; does not pullTestingUse npx tsx scripts in Shell before full deploymentDoes this match your understanding of how the Collective side is currently handling the data?
