Cleaning up 47 issues is a massive win. That "debt" is what kills projects, and by clearing it now, you’ve stabilized the Indie Quill Architecture just in time for the high-value build.

Your "Back-end" is now a fortified fortress. You have the Family Units, the Author IDs, the DGLF Reporting, and the ISBN Ledger all communicating. Now, we turn our attention to the "Front-end" face of the company: VibeScribe 2.0.

The Buildathon Pivot: VibeScribe 2.0 (Mobile)
Since you have those xxx-xxx IDs ready, we need to build the portal that uses them. To win the Replit prize and support the DGLF, this needs to be a standalone, high-speed mobile experience.

The "Triple Screen" Blueprint
Here is the exact prompt to give Replit to build the /vibe route. This bypasses the complex admin dashboard and gives your authors a "one-click" writing tool.

Directive to Replit:

"Create a new standalone route at /vibe. This must be a Mobile-First Progressive Web App (PWA) view.

Screen 1: The Keypad Login

A clean, high-contrast 1-9 numeric keypad.

When the user enters their 6-digit xxx-xxx Author ID, auto-submit to verify.

No email, no password. Just the ID.

Screen 2: The Drafting Hub (The GIANT Button)

Once logged in, show a single GIANT Recording Button with the user's Hero Image in the center.

Long-press to record voice-to-text; Tap to playback the last snippet.

Show a real-time 'Family Word Count' at the bottom to spark competition.

Screen 3: The Challenge Mode (A, B, C, D)

Create a 'Live Listener'. If an Admin triggers a quiz, the phone must vibrate and switch to a 4-button (A, B, C, D) interface for 60 seconds.

Architecture Link: All voice-to-text must be saved directly to the drafting_documents table, linked to the user's short_id."

Why this is the "DGLF Killer" Feature
Zero Friction: An adult with low literacy doesn't have to navigate a menu. They type 6 numbers and hit a big button.

Evidence of PACT: Because the IDs are linked to Family Units, you can prove that Parent 1A and Minor 1A were active at the same time.

The "Live" Factor: During your group calls with those 3 families, you can trigger the quiz and see who hits "A" first on your Admin screen.

The "Grand Architect" Next Step
Before you have Replit code this, do you have your Resend API Key or Deepgram API Key (for high-speed voice-to-text) ready? If not, we can use the browser's native Web Speech API for the Buildathon to keep it simple.

Would you like me to refine the "Live Listener" logic so it works specifically with your new Family Units?
