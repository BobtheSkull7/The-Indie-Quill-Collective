VibeScribe is a native iOS accessibility application designed to bridge the literacy gap. By replacing complex interfaces with a "Giant Button" and a simple 6-digit keypad, we empower authors and students in disadvantaged communities to capture their stories, legacies, and "vibes" without the barrier of traditional typing.

## The Four Pillars of VibeScribe
1. **Voice Practice (The Recorder):** Practice spoken language through a high-fidelity native recording interface.
2. **Visual Literacy (The Transcription):** Real-time AI transcription (Whisper AI) provides immediate visual reinforcement of spoken words.
3. **Audio Audit (Playback):** High-quality playback of transcribed text, allowing users to hear their own stories read back in plain English.
4. **Gamification (Word Counter):** A real-time word counter that celebrates progress, turning storytelling into a measurable "win."
